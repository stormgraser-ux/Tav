        "One thing that will help with making this build powerful in the late game is not killing the Strange Ox in the Druid's Grove. He will later provide you with Hat of Fire Acuity in Act 2 (you will have to kill it) Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Spellsparkler\nWhen used with Magic Missile​ you can generate multiple Lightning Charges and drastically improve the damage output of the spell.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nGives +1 to spell attack rolls or DC. An alternative to The Spellsparkler in case it is used by someone else.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nCan be used to apply damage and attack roll buffs in various combat encounters. Wearing it together with other staves will require Dual Wielder​ feat.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have used for bonus action if your Sorcery points have been expended, so this will allow some bonus damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nIncreases Spell Save Difficulty Counter, while obscured. Very easy to activate, use Shift, to see the sun icon, it should be half or full empty.\n\n\nThe Lifebringer\nThe best defensive option in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler. Without it, the item loses its purpose.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nWorks well with The Spellsparkler for additional bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws with Lightning Charges. The best choice in Act 1.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nApplies Reverbation when dealing thunder or lightning damage. With 5 stacks, this will deal a bonus 1d4 damage and can make enemies Prone. This can be easily achieved once you have The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nGives whooping +2 Armour Class. This is the perfect option especially if you do not have shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves that allow to negate enemy ranged attack.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nExcellent shoes for applying Reverbation. However, if you have a Cleric or other Spirit Guardians​ user I would save these on them.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nAmulet\nPsychic Spark\nExcellent amulet which improves Magic Missile​ effectiveness, making it one of the best spells in the early game.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nA good amulet that allows restoring level 3 or lower spell slots. This way you could get additional sorcery points.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nA good amulet to obtain mobility via Misty Step.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows Casting invisibility for free once per long rest.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells works with 5 Reverbation stacks from Boots of Stormy Clamour."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nContinue using weapons from Act 1, as nothing comes close in terms of usefulness.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nStill, the best bow, as initiative plays a vital role for the first mover advantage during encounters.\n\n\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nPair it with another hand crossbow like Hand Crossbow +1 or Ne'er Misser. It has special Scorching Ray​ which does not use spell slots.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nCan be useful to precast Haste​ in some encounters.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters.\n\n\nHead\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThe core item of the build, that enables using Scorching Ray​ to get 100% spell success chance.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nSame armor from Act 1 that improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nGives bonus Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThe best gloves in terms of stacking bonus Reverbation, especially via Callous Glow Ring effect.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying various conditions.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nDefensive shoes that improve Armor Class.\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet\nVery powerful amulet with single target spells like Scorching Ray. Each hit will apply reverbation, allowing for bonus thunder damage and constant Prone effects.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nIt allows casting a Shield​ spell and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nIt is an excellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nEnsures high attack rolls with Scorching Ray. Of course, the disadvantage to saving throw is a big problem, so evaluate how well you can hit your foes.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds another Dazed effect that can be procced after 5 Reverbation stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMarkoheshkir\nThe ultimate caster weapon that enables the Arcane Battery​ effect, special Kereska's Favour action, and other bonuses. You can pick Flame of Wrath or Bolts of Doom, depending on whether you want improvements in terms of fire damage or lightning riders.\n\n\nRhapsody\nA very powerful weapon, that improves damage and attack rolls with each killed foe up to +3.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nGives the Arcane Battery​ effect which will save spell slots when casting high-level spells. Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThe best helmet throughout the game, it will help you stack Spell Save DC using Scorching Ray.\n\n\nBirthright\nGives +2 Charisma, which will allow you to reach 24 with all the bonuses.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nA good caster headwear that gives bonuses to spell attack rolls and spell save DC.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImproves Spell Save DC. However, the main caveat is that this cloak is in demand by all casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nIf you have light armor proficiency from race, this is a very powerful armor and the best one for the caster. The Constitution Saving Throw advantage is a huge boon. It also improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nImproves Spell Save DC and also Armour Class. Excellent caster robe.\n\n\nRobe of Supreme Defences\nImproves Saving Throw success by giving a bonus based on your spellcasting modifier.\n\n\nGloves\nSpellmight Gloves\nThe best gloves in terms of damage, however, they do decrease attack rolls.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are ridiculously powerful as they have a bugged mechanic of doubling the damage riders and their force damage rolls.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGood gloves with a boost to Spell Save DC\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nBoosts Spell Save DC by 1.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill, excellent boots as they will help generate stacks of Reverbation.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nGives an option to pass a Saving Throw using reaction. Moreover, improves the movement via Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game, enabling free movement on difficult terrains and giving Misty Step.\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet\nVery powerful amulet with single target spells like Scorching Ray. Each hit will apply reverbation, allowing for bonus thunder damage and constant Prone effects.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nProvides +2 Spell Save DC. However, it is better used on Cleric to get the bonus Channel Divinity charge.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nAllows restoring any level of spell slot.\n\n\nRings\n-\nUse the ones from previous acts."

        "The early game can be hard, as you do not know where to find items. I would like to point out that you will be using only one weapon in this act, and it is two-handed. You will also get Knife of the Undermountain King, but it will be used later in Act 2. Dual Wield Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best shortsword in Act 1, will lead you to Act 2. It gives higher critical rolls and improves damage output. Can be dual-wielded.\n\n\nScimitar +1\nThese are the only good weapons that can be used to wear for the first part of the game.\n\n\nShortsword +1\n\n\nHunter's Dagger\nThis has a Ruptured​ effect, which can be utilized pretty well when enemies are forced to move. I would wear this in the offhand.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nImproves initiative and allows going earlier in combat. I recommend this if you plan on using Dual-wielding weapons.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nThese weapons can be dual-wielded, making them perfect very early in the game. Use this before obtaining better ones. What makes this good is that it can use bonus action for additional damage. Ranged Setup Weapons You can also equip a shield (strange right?) for this build when going ranged, if using Strenth Elixir or not picking Titanstring Bow. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best shortsword in Act 1, will lead you to Act 2. It gives higher critical rolls and improves damage output. Can be dual-wielded.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis club should be equipped if you plan on using Titanstring Bow without Strength Elixirs. This way you will maximize your damage from the Strength modifier. It can be dual-wielded with the next weapon - Knife of the Undermountain King without Dual Wielder​ feat.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nI would say this is the best bow if you plan on using Strength Elixirs or Club of Hill Giant Strength to get high strength. This way you will deal bonus damage, outdamaging other ranged weapon options throughout the game.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nThis is an amazing bow, as it can apply Frighten on enemies making them unable to move. This is not as powerful as Titanstring Bow but a good alternative in case you want more control in combat.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nThese weapons can be dual-wielded, making them perfect very early in the game. Use this before obtaining the ones above. What makes this good is that it can use a bonus action for additional damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nVery good shield similar to Safeguard Shield, just gives a bonus Heroism​ cantrip. Only use it if you have Absolute's Brand.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helm\nProvides a bonus Saving Throw while obscured, which is great for avoiding the effects of some spells.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nIncreases movement speed at the start of the combat for 3 turns. I think this is the best helmet for Act 1, if you are using melee attacks.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nOnly obtainable if you have Dark Urge Origin. After killing an enemy it gives invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nGives +2 Dexterity (up to a maximum of 20). This will improve your rolls and damage. As this is Cloth it provides only 10 Armour Class.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nAs a ranger, you can wear medium armor. For the early game, before obtaining The Graceful Cloth this can be a decent choice. However, you will gain disadvantage on stealth checks which is important part of the build.\n\n\nSpidersilk Armour\nAs there are not many good choices for light armour this is somewhat decent.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Archery\nBest gloves for Ranged attacks.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nA solid choice for melee approach, as you can easily gain advantage via multiple enemies sitting together.\n\n\nGloves of Power\nGives a bonus to Sleight of Hand for better picklock chances. Moreover, applies the status effect, and penalizes the target.\n\n\nGloves of Thievery\nAlthough nothing fancy for combat, these are amazing for Pickpocketing, Chests, and traps.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nGreat boots that can be used to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nAllows walking on Difficult Terrain without movement speed penalties.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet that gives a direct damage bonus. However, you will need someone to heal you, this will most likely be a healer or just chug a potion.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives access to Misty Step, in case you need a way to quickly or cover long distances.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIt's easy to activate it as you have multiple spells to concentrate on. This will result in bonus psychic damage.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows casting Invisibility​ that can be used to approach combat in the perfect position.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThis is a very powerful ring, that may be useful even till the end game, due to flat bonus damage.\n\n\nSmuggler's Ring\nAlthough this does not provide any combat bonuses, it is very useful in world exploration and pickpocketing."

        "This is the mid-game, where most areas will be covered by darkness. Radiant equipment will shine here, and having Darkvision​ is recommended. You can also get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. Dual Wield Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nRender of Mind and Body\nThis item is very powerful due to the big 1d8 psychic damage bonus. It will be one of the best until the end of the game.\n\n\nJusticiar's Scimitar\nYou can blind the target thanks to the Assassinate: Initiative, but most importantly, it has a unique attack that deals bonus damage based on proficiency and 1d6 psychic.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nIncreases critical roll range and improves damage rolls.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nIf you need an option to cast Haste​, this bow is amazing. Otherwise, go with the bow from Act 1. Ranged Setup Weapons To be honest, you can stay with the same weapons from Act 1. Shield is only valuable if you are not using Club of Hill Giant Strength. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best shortsword in Act 1, will lead you to Act 2. It gives higher critical rolls and improves damage output. Can be dual-wielded.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis club should be equipped if you plan on using Titanstring Bow without Strength Elixirs. This way you will maximize your damage from the Strength modifier. It can be dual-wielded with the next weapon - Knife of the Undermountain King without Dual Wielder​ feat.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best weapon if you have high strength from Strenth Elixirs or Club of Hill Giant Strength\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nAn alternative to Titanstring Bow, for some control capabilities.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nGives a big initiative boost, making it the best choice in my opinion.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nMarksmanship Hat\nThe best headwear if you are doing ranged setup, as it will increase hit chance. In Act 3 it loses most of its value.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIncreases the success likelihood of critical chance while obscured. This means that you should stand in lightly dimmed places.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIncreases the success likelihood of critical chance while obscured. This means that you should stand in lightly dimmed places.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nCan still be used in Act 2 as the invisibility effect is just that good.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nA very good cloak, with a good bonus to Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nUpgraded version of the below armor, the casting of Shield of Faith​ is a great way to obtain bonus damage from Strange Conduit Ring and some additional survivability. It also looks cool!\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nYou can get a bonus 2 Armour Class from Shield of Faith​ to improve survivability. Moreover, you get an Advantage on Stealth checks.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis medium armor does not impose any disadvantage on stealth and gives bonus initiative rolls. It can give the highest armour class with high Dexterity until later in Act 3.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nThe improved version of Dark Justiciar Gauntlets also allows casting Darkness spells.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus 1d4 fire damage with weapon attacks and can inflict bleeding. The best choice early in Act 2.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nGives a bonus of 1d4 Necrotic damage with weapon attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nStill an amazing option for the Gloomstalker Assasin Build\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives bonus Armour Class. A good survivability choice, but not mandatory in my opinion.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nVery interesting choice. Because the build will deal a decent amount of critical hits, this will allow it to paralyze many humanoid enemies. Give this one a try.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe amulet will be a good option until endgame as the 1d6 poison damage is a good boost. However, it does not allow coatings, so be sure to check for alternatives if you plan on using them.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nThis is a bit more powerful than the ring below, but it requires your foes to be at least lightly obscured.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThe bonus damage is a good choice even in Act 2.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nJust a mention of this ring. If you are playing Assassin optimally, this ring is not necessary as you will get Advantage by default. However, as there are various combat situations, this can prove useful. Otherwise, use it on another build."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. Getting them as early as possible will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Dual Wield Setup Weapons You will want Piercing weapons to exploit the bonus damage from vulnerabilities. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nCrimson Mischief(BiS)\nGives a flat 7-piece damage boost. Together with Aura Of Murder,​ this will result in 14 damage. If using Blade of the First Blood, it is not as powerful, so look at the other options.\n\n\nBelm(BiS)\nCan use bonus action attacks to inflict the same damage as the main hand weapon, with all bonuses.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThe dagger's critical damage bonuses also apply main weapon.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nI recommend using this weapon if you did not obtain Bhaalist Armour, to get the Aura Of Murder​ effect. This offers a piercing vulnerability debuff if attacked with the main hand.\n\n\nRender of Mind and Body\nAs you have multiple ways of getting an Advantage, the 1d8 psychic damage rider is a very large bonus, making this weapon very powerful even in Act 3.\n\n\nRhapsody\nThis weapon is a good recommendation. I would not say it is necessary, but the flat bonus damage is good to have.\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow(BiS)\nThe bow is the best pick in terms of damage boost as it gives +7 on all weapon attacks. With Assassinate: Ambush,​ this will be an easy way to get a huge boost in damage.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nDecreases the roll requirement for Critical Hit by 1.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives +3 Initiative, almost guaranteeing that you go first. Ranged Setup Weapons This is the optimal option and uses mainly ranged attacks Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRhapsody\nGives a flat 3 bonus damage and increased hit chance after you pump this item with killed foes.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThis item is somewhat bugged and its bonus damage applies even when using Ranged attacks. So you can get 7 bonus damages on critical hits, and you will do a lot of them during the Surprise rounds\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA slight improvement to damage and gives increased crit range. The latter is not as important as you will get guaranteed crits on Surprise rounds.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nStill an option to equip if you do not use Strength Elixirs with Titanstring Bow.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThis is the best bow in the game if you or any party member uses Bhaalist Armour. It can deal the highest possible damage of all ranged weapons if you have a vulnerability effect. You also need high strength which can be reached with Club of Hill Giant Strength or Strength Elixirs.\n\n\nGontr Mael\nIt is the most powerful bow, if you will not be utilizing the Bhaalist Armour effect.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nGives a flat damage boost on critical hits. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nWill boost your damage based on the spellcasting modifier. If it is 14 Wisdom, this will result in bonus 2. However, I would limit this item to Paladin if you have it in your group. If not - use it! You will also need to do a respec. Start with Fighter or Rogue and pick Ranger as the last class, so that your spellcasting modifier becomes Wisdom.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIf using Broodmother's Revenge, this helmet's effect ensures that you get bonus damage on every combat encounter.\n\n\nMask of Soul Perception\nA good item with bonuses to attack and initiative rolls. Overall, I think it has minimal benefits for Gloomstalker Assassin, especially as your goal is to utilize the Surprise rounds, and avoid direct combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle(BiS)\nA perfect mantle to constantly get invisible after an enemy kills. Still a solid option for Act 3.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nEnsures good survivability, by imposing a disadvantage on attacker Attack Rolls.\n\n\nShade-Slayer Cloak\nIt boosts critical chance. The caveat is that you have to attack from hiding for this to activate, which sometimes can be complicated. I would also use this with the Thief Subclass, and skip it on Assassin as it automatically lands critical hits when attacking surprised enemies.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis armor is particularly powerful for melee-piercing weapon wielders - these include daggers and short swords.  It makes them vulnerable to piercing damage unless they have resistance to it. Moreover, it gives bonus initiative, ensuring that you will go first most of the time due to the assassin's high initiative already.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThis medium armor perfectly works with stealth as it does not impose any disadvantages. Moreover, it has a decent armor class for protection.\n\n\nGloves\nCraterflesh Gloves(BiS)\nThese gloves are a powerful option. The 1d6 turns into 2d6 due to their bugged effect on Honour Mode. They also inherit damage riders. This will probably be fixed sometime in the future.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nOne of the best gloves in the game with bonuses for pure damage, however, could have limited access based on your decisions in the game.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese gloves provide bonuses for every attack. You will be doing many of them so the bonus fire damage stacks up\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nIncur 6d6 damage, but gain additional attack points. This neatly fits into the Assassin playstyle as you can deal damage bonuses on the first turn.\n\n\nStalker Gloves\nThe bonus damage on stealth is a good effect and you also gain a bonus initiative roll.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nThese boots have a wide array of uses - allowing succeeding Saving Throws while using Reaction, a teleportation spell, and ignoring difficult terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives Freedom of Movement​ and Longstrider​ actions effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nBonus poison damage on each hit with the weapon is a great improvement\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nA powerful choice for Act 3 as it will guarantee paralysis and critical hits from the melee range.\n\n\nMagic Amulet\nGives an Advantage on attack. I would use this only if you do not have Risky Ring. Otherwise, this does not provide much use, besides Saving Throw Advantage.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring(BiS)\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nA great ring for bonus damage, but requires your foes to be Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAmazing choice till the end of the game as each attack will apply this bonus acid damage."

        "So, for the majority of Act 1, you will be a standard caster build. The build only becomes reasonably effective from level 6. So, I would like to split the gear recommendation into two parts: Pre level 6 - caster equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Spellsparkler\nWhen used with Magic Missile,​ you can generate multiple Lightning Charges and drastically improve the damage output of the spell.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nGives +1 to spell attack rolls or DC. An alternative to The Spellsparkler in case it is used by someone else.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nIt can be used to apply damage and attack roll buffs in various combat encounters. Wearing it together with other staves will require Dual Wielder​ feat.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have used for bonus action if your Sorcery points have been expended, so this will allow some bonus damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nIncreases Spell Save Difficulty Counter, while obscured. Very easy to activate, use Shift, to see the sun icon, it should be half or full empty.\n\n\nThe Lifebringer\nThe best defensive option in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler. Without it, the item loses its purpose.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best spellcaster robe in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler for additional bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws with Lightning Charges.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nApplies Reverbation when dealing thunder or lightning damage. With 5 stacks, this will deal a bonus 1d4 damage and can make enemies Prone. This can be easily achieved once you have The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nGives whooping +2 Armour Class. This is the perfect option, especially if you do not have shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves that allow you to negate enemy ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nExcellent shoes for applying Reverbation. However, if you have a Cleric or other Spirit Guardians​ user I would save these on them.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives additional protection against being Prone.\n\n\nAmulet\nPsychic Spark\nExcellent amulet which improves Magic Missile​ effectiveness, making it one of the best spells in the early game.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nA good amulet that allows restoring level 3 or lower spell slots. This way you could get additional sorcery points.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nA good amulet to obtain mobility via Misty Step.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows Casting invisibility for free once per long rest.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells works with 5 Reverbation stacks from Boots of Stormy Clamour. Level 6 - reflective damage setup Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMourning Frost\nThis is a great staff, both for hitting to apply Chilled​ and bonus cold damage, which will apply to Armour of Agathys.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nIf you don't have a cleric who can use this sword, I would then equip it using Dual Wielder​ feat. The Phalar Aluve: Shriek​ can get some ridiculous damage riders on reflection damage.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is an amazing weapon as you can use a bonus action to break water bottles to apply wet.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nThe goal here is to remove any critical hit chances so that you have better survivability.\n\n\nHead\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, which means that you can provoke more Attacks of Opportunity.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nThis helmet works the other way around; it reflects damage when enemies miss you. So it's not the best pick, and better used on a full-fledged cleric.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Oak Father's Embrace\nIn terms of damage reflection, this armor is the simplest pick and works against two enemy types that you meet in Act 1 and Act 2.\n\n\nInfernal Robe\nI would say this is the best robe in Act 1. Once you are level 6-7, you can start reflecting damage as an Abjuration Wizard, and this armor allows using Fire Shield: Warm, for bonus damage together with Armour of Agathys. It does have a very unpopular decision requirement....\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nReduces incoming damage, but does come with high Armour Class, which would reduce the enemy's hit chances.\n\n\nGloves\nWinter's Clutches\nI love these gloves as they pair well with Mourning Frost to apply the Encrusted with Frost​ effect.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nIf you do melee attacks with your weapon, these gloves are excellent for that, as they will debuff your targets.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAll of these boots will help you walk freely on Ice. The Disintegrating Night Walkers are especially powerful as they allow walking on almost any difficult surface.\n\n\nHoarfrost Boots\n\n\nBoots of Striding\n\n\nThe Watersparkers\nThese can be a great boot choice, especially as you will use Create Water​ during combat.\n\n\nAmulet\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nIn case you reach Downed​ state, this amulet will help you get up.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestore up to a level 3 spell slot. Can be unequipped after use.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nAmazing ring that allows moving longer distances.\n\n\nThe Sparkswall\nReduces lightning damage received, especially useful to combo with The Watersparkers."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\n-\nWeapons from the previous Act.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nShield\nAbsolute's Protector\nThis gives you Fire Shield: Chill, which further generates ice damage.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nGives bonus Spell Save DC, which is amazing for better success when casting spells.\n\n\nIronvine Shield\nTo effectively use this shield, you need to get Shillelagh. The only way to obtain this cantrip is to get Magic Initiate: Druid​ and pick it there. However, I found its damage reflection not to work that good, so I skipped the shield.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nIf you are more inclined for spellcasting maybe using scrolls, I would go with this, as it improves spell success chance.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nThis hat can apply additional Encrusted with Frost​ when attacking using Booming Blade.\n\n\nCloak\nFleshmelter Cloak\nThe best cloak in terms of damage reflection\n\n\nArmor\nThe Oak Father's Embrace\nFor Act 2, this is hands down the best armor for reflection damage. There are plenty of undead enemies that will gladly enjoy this reflected damage.\n\n\nRippling Force Mail\nAnother option for armour to stack Force Conduit​ and reduce incoming damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nAs you are a caster at the core, you can use melee attacks with Booming Blade​ to build up Arcane Acuity.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nWith Mourning Frost equipped you have an easy source of cold damage to apply Encrusted with Frost​.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nThe Act 1 boots that give Prone​ resistance are my picks.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots, and unequip after that.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis ring can do nice reflection damage as it procs on Armour of Agathys​ and Fleshmelter Cloak.\n\n\nTrue Love's Caress\nEquip this ring and allow a party member to cast Warding Bond​ on you while wearing True Love's Embrace. This will give you resistance to all the damage, greatly improving survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nStill a good ring for better movement distance.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nAn option for creating ice fields. This does give some control options, but enemies that are Prone​ will not attack you, reducing the reflection damage.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nWhile obscured (which happens when standing in shadows) you get a bonus armor class for survivability."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible, you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Here you have a few weapon setup options: Main hand weapon - Markoheshkir, Phalar Aluve, etc. with a shield in the offhand\nDual wielding with Dual Wielder​ feat - Markoheshkir + Phalar Aluve or Phalar Aluve + Rhapsody, etc. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best staff for a spellcaster. Even though the build maximizes reflective damage, you are still a full spellcaster wizard, which can utilize spells like Cone of Cold​ or Chain Lightning. So activate Kereska's Favour​ and pick either Bolts of Doom​ or Frost of Dark Winter.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nAnother spellcaster weapon alternative with Spell Save DC boost and access to Arcane Battery.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis can be worn both as Dual Wielder​ option or in the main hand. The Phalar Aluve: Shriek​ gives multiple damage riders on reflective damage. Still, if you have another caster like a cleric who can activate Phalar Aluve, then go for the other weapon option.\n\n\nMourning Frost\nThe Act 1 staff is still relevant. In case you do occasional Booming Blade, otherwise I would go for other options.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nRhapsody\nOffhand weapon with Scarlet Remittance​ effect for substantial spellcasting boost.\n\n\nShield\nSwires' Sledboard\nAllows stacking Force Conduit,​ which reduces incoming damage.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nHead\nHelm of Balduran\nYou can use the helmet together with The Reviving Hands to always activate Blade Ward.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nThe hood gives solid +2 Spell Save DC, greatly improving spell success chance.\n\n\nCloak\nFleshmelter Cloak\nEasy source of reflective damage, which will also proc some other damage riders like Callous Glow Ring.\n\n\nArmor\nBonespike Garb\nThe best reflective armor\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nWhile using this armour, you have a source of Blade Ward​ reducing the incoming damage, and needing to use The Reviving Hands.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nJust a pure caster alternative to better land those spells. \n\n\nGloves\nThe Reviving Hands\nThese can work together with Helm of Balduran or Ring of Regeneration to activate Blade Ward​ and greatly reduce incoming damage.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, also gives a level 3 Command​ spell for each Long Rest. The gloves provide +1 Spell Save DC,\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nVery good gloves, but might be contested by other builds, specifically martial ones.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nGives better movement mobility and ignores various surface effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nContinues to be one of the best boot options.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nThis amulet not only improves your survivability but also makes it easier to concentrate on spells. Another underlying reason is Bonespike Garb, which uses the constitution modifier for damage reflection.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe +2 Spell Save DC is a huge boost, giving a large success improvement for spells.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe best ring in terms of damage. It stacks multiple times with various reflection effects.\n\n\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThis is the only ring that gives a bonus Spell Save DC. This may be a bug that might be patched in the future.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nCan be used to activate The Reviving Hands if you don't have Warding Bond​ or a support caster to apply Blade Ward.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe ring is still a solid choice to maintain optimal Armour Class.\n\n\nTrue Love's Caress\nEquip this ring and allow a party member to cast Warding Bond​ on you while wearing True Love's Embrace. This will give you resistance to all the damage, greatly improving survivability, without the need to increase armor."

Ranged Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best bow in the game, however, it does require you to pump up strength. I covered some options in the ability maximization section. Generally, my recommendation would be to use Club of Hill Giant Strength as it simplifies things.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nAn interesting alternative bow, that applies Frightened on enemies. If you have Arrow of Many Targets, this is a perfect way to apply some control with each of your shots.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these early in the game. This is the best option in my opinion for high damage, and before you obtain Club of Hill Giant Strength. Melee stat stick slots You can equip both or equip just one and use a shield. If you have shield proficiency, there are some decent options in the off-hand: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis is my recommendation if you plan on using Titanstring Bow as it will result in a very high damage boost.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nOne of the best stat sticks in Act 1, giving improved crit chance and a slight damage boost via dice rerolls.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nThe best shield in Act 1, with good bonuses and immunity to crit hits.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nCan be obtained very early with a slight boost to saving throws. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nGives a damage boost based on the spellcasting modifier. The activation of the bonus should be easy.\n\n\nShadow of Menzoberranzan\nAllows for becoming invisible, perfect for some surprise round setups.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, to reach perfect shooting position. However, I would prioritize this on melee characters.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nBecome invisible after killing an enemy.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nAnother powerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\nA 15 AC armor with slight damage reduction.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Very solid option with a high Armour Class that you can use from level 3.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese can be an excellent choice if you are not using Cloud of Hill Giant Strenght elixirs. Moreover, they are also useful thanks to the +1 Attack roll bonus.\n\n\nGloves of Archery\nRanged attacks will deal an additional 2 damage. Moreover, these gloves will give proficiency with Longbows if your race doesn't have it.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nIt is one of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives improved movement when you cast a spell with Concentration. Moreover, you can walk on Ice without falling.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially if enemies are far.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet in the game that gives a direct boost to damage.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nAdds flat 2 damage bonus.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a slight psychic damage boost while concentrating on spells.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed, making it easier to reach your targets."

You can dual-wield them or use only one + shield.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best bow in the and continues to be for the rest of the game.\n\n\nShield - if not dual-wielding\nKetheric's Shield\nOne of the best shields in the game. It will improve Spell Save DC and make it easier to land spells.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nGives a huge boost to initiative.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nAllows to start stacking Arcane Acuity for higher spell success.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe bonus damage based on your Charisma modifier will give a significant boost.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives a slight boost to ranged attack rolls.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nIt allows you to get bonus damage from an element. However, it is bugged and works only once a long rest.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nNo matter, which one you get, both of these are powerful armor choices. They will be useful for the start of Act 3.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nA solid medium armor, that has no limit to AC bonus from high Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nGives bonus fire damage. It is not much better than Gloves of Archery, but a slight boost to strength saving throws can be useful in a few situations.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nGreat intermediary gloves, opening up dexterity abilities and giving a bonus to attack rolls.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nThe additional Armor Class is a great bonus.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives improved movement when you cast a spell with Concentration. Moreover, you can walk on Ice without falling.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet in the game that gives a direct boost to damage.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nA very powerful ring, that will give a permanent advantage on attacks.

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nClub of Hill Giant Strength(BiS)\nIf you are not using Strength Elixirs or Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength this is the easiest way to maintain high enough Strength to get substantial damage bonuses on Titanstring Bow.\n\n\nRhapsody\nOne of the best stat stick weapons in the game. It will improve not only damage but Spell Save DC with each enemy kill for a total of +3 bonus.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nAnother crazy powerful stat stick, that allows dealing additional damage on critical hits with ranged weapons. This is fairly easy in the late game as you can use Hold Monster​ or Hold Person​ to easily guarantee these.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nStat stick from Act 1, that can be decent to slightly improve the damage of ranged attacks.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow(BiS)\nStill the best bow in the game, with how high strength you can get via various items. If you are not having high strength, I would skip it\n\n\nGontr Mael\nSecond best bow in the game. It does trade blows with Titanstring Bow, especially if you will not use Bhaalist Armour for piercing vulnerability. In that case, I would go with this option.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nA decent bow, which is generally used as a stat stick for other builds.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity(BiS)\nThis is the best item for the build to help stack Spell Saves DC via the arcane acuity effect.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nPowerful cloak especially when you need to avoid enemy hits to maintain spell concentration.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThe best armor in the game comes with a major caveat. It does require you to enter close range to enemies for the Aura Of Murder​ effect. If you can, I would use this on another melee build so that you could safely attack from range while the effect is active. Otherwise, try to find \"the sweet spot\" where there is still not Threatened status and you can activate the aura.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe best medium armor in the game, that has no Armour Class bonus limits from Dexterity.e\n\n\nElegant Studded Leather\nLight armor option with Shield​ and bonuses to the initiative.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nOne of the best gloves in the game, giving improved hit chance and damage boost. The damage boost will also work with Aura Of Murder​ from Bhaalist Armour piercing vulnerability.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nI like these gloves as they fit the build very well, giving both weapon damage bonuses and improved Spell Save DC.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are bugged and ridiculously powerful. With an easy way to land critical hits using Hold Monster​/Hold Person,​ you get separate instances of damage, creating a trickling effect of more damage, which is a bug rather than a feature.\n\n\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThese gloves will most likely go to one of the martials to get the strength to 23. If not, it can be worn on this build for additional damage with Titanstring Bow.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes(BiS)\nAs this is a ranged build, there is not much need to walk on slippery surfaces, so just pumping AC slightly is the best option here\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nAllows you to force a successful Saving Throw using a reaction.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout(BiS)\nGives +2 Spell Save DC. However, this item is highly contested by casters and particularly clerics, so I would leave it to them.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nOne of the best amulets as it gives bonus damage.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nGives a huge survivability boost and ensures that it's highly unlikely that your Concentration saving throws fail.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nCan be used to restore a spell slot and then unequip it.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel(BiS)\nThe best ring for this build. Together with Helmet of Arcane Acuity you can pump up spell save DC, and then cast most of the control spells with bonus action.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe psychic damage bonus is good, especially if you use Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nLess of a priority especially as it will be easy to get an Advantage through various control spells at your disposal.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nAn easy +2 radiant damage on each attack.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nEasy +2 Acid damage on each hit.\n\n\nRing of Protection\n+1 Armour Class and Saving Throws, excellent ring for improved protection."

        "Be sure to get Resonance Stone in the Mind Flayer Colony at the end of Act 2. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nDrakethroat Glaive\nCan be used to apply the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for an additional damage rider. This is not used as a main hand weapon.\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThe core item of this build, that you obtain at level 8 Eldritch Knight by learning the Shadow Blade​ spell. It is the strongest one-handed weapon, and with some optimizations, can reach ridiculous damage numbers.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nCan be used to apply the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for additional damage rider.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nOff-hand weapon option, which improves the critical rolls range and slightly improves overall weapon damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nA very powerful shield that enables critical attack immunity.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nA decent shield with a good boost to initiative.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nExcellent bow as a stat stick, providing an initiative boost.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nGives a free Haste​ use. Nothing fancy, especially as there are Potion of Speed to be found, but the duration is longer.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best headwear to use in terms of damage boost. This comes from the Arcane Synergy​ effect, which is easy to activate using Booming Blade.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nAbsorbing the elements adds a damage rider on the next attack. \n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nOne of the best-looking armours, and great options for maximizing spell concentration. You will obtain either of these depending on the Act 2 major decision regarding Nightsong. They also give a special Shield of Faith​ action that helps activate the Strange Conduit Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nReaper's Embrace\nThe best heavy armor in Act 2, gives slight damage reduction and looks just cool!\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nA good heavy armor, especially in the middle of Act 2. Still, you will get some better options later on.\n\n\nPotent Robe\nIn terms of pure offensive, this is the best armour as it improves Booming Blade​ damage. Sadly, it will impair your Armour Class, but it can be somewhat alleviated with Mage Armour.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nExcellent medium armor that has full scaling from Dexterity ability modifier.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nExcellent gloves to debuff enemies with Baneful Strike. This can help land spells for your allies as you hit multiple enemies and weaken them\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game, which are obtained in Act 1.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives Prone​ while concentrating on spells. You can use cheap ones like Enlarge​ or something from scrolls.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives psychic damage rider while you are concentrating on a spell. This can be anything, like Protection from Evil and Good​ or Enlarge​\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nAn interesting choice that you can use to create ice fields. This does require a cold damage rider on your weapon from the Draconic Elemental Weapon buff with Drakethroat Glaive.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks."

        "Overall, the equipment section revolves around one key item - Helmet of Grit. If you are okay running it and can equip Amulet of Greater Health you can run with two bonus actions. Specifically for Eldritch Knight, this gives insane options: Two attacks with War Magic​\nOne attack with War Magic​ and cast a spell with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel I go into these setups more below, but giving a heads up, on what to expect. High Damage Setup Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThis continues to be your main weapon when summoned with the Shadow Blade​ spell.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nRhapsody\nIn general, this would be the best weapon, as it would give a direct damage boost to all weapon attacks. The problem arises if you use Helmet of Grit and need to activate the second bonus action. Unless you have Haste​ or activate Action Surge,​ you will not be able to activate Booming Blade​ a second time. If this sounds like a hassle, look at the next option.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nExcellent weapon choice if you can guarantee critical hits. The easiest way is via Hold Monster​/Hold Person. Pair it with Vicious Shortbow for maximum damage.\n\n\nAmbusher\nCan add a necrotic damage rider on enemies that did not take a turn yet.\n\n\nBelm\nComes with a Perfectly Balanced Strike​ action, which replicates the damage of a main-hand weapon while only using a bonus action. This is only a relevant pick if you have problems activating War Magic​ a second time with Helmet of Grit. Otherwise, go for Rhapsody.\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nIn terms of pure damage boost, this is the best bow, especially as you can easily guarantee critical hits via Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a whooping +3 to initiative, I would only use it without the Alert​ feat.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nReduces the critical roll requirements, giving a slight average damage boost.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game with a stacked feature set and higher Armour Class.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nA very powerful shield that enables critical attack immunity, which I think is important if you are running Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nIn terms of combat potential, this is the best headwear if you pair it with the Amulet of Greater Health. Eldritch Knight has a way to effectively use 2 bonus actions. However, the health loss is not for everyone, and might even seem too risky.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAlternative to the Ring of Arcane Synergy. The effect gives a substantial damage boost via Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nStraightforward headwear option that adds necrotic damage rider on each attack.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nThe best cloak in terms of defensive capabilities, as it gives the enemy a disadvantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Persistence\nAn alternative heavy armour that also gives Blade Ward​ to reduce incoming damage.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nThe best armour in terms of combat damage potential. This gives Aura Of Murder​ a doubling of damage of all piercing attacks. Even if you do not use these weapons, your archers can benefit from this effect.\n\n\nPotent Robe\nIf you are okay with some risks and having a lower base armour class, this robe offers improved damage when hitting with Booming Blade. It will add a full charisma modifier to the damage of your weapon type. As EK, you have various options to improve survivability - Shield, Mirror Image, etc.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe only option to wear if you would like to negate critical hits from the enemies. This greatly improves survivability, especially when you are running Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nOne of the best gloves in terms of direct damage boost via damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are very powerful, especially if you have other controllers in the group that can consistently cast Hold Monster​/Hold Person. What makes these gloves special is that they inherit some damage riders, making the bonus force damage even higher than it should be.\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nListing these gloves as they could give additional attacks to the already ridiculous number of attacks the Eldritch Knight does. Still, with Helmet of Grit and having half HP, this can be somewhat risky to use.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nImproves Spell Save DC and gives a fire damage rider. This is an excellent option if you want to lean into spellcasting, but still retain damage potential.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nBoth of these are some of the best boots in the game. Use any of these to improve your movement on various terrains and avoid negative effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMy go-to pick for an amulet, mandatory if you are using Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nBest offensive amulet, giving poison damage rider. You will need to get healing from another source to activate it, like a potion or a cleric's Healing Word.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nVery powerful accessory that gives direct damage boost via Arcane Synergy. Use this or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The bonus depends on spellcasting modifier, so that is why Charisma is so high on the build.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nExcellent ring that easily gives a damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGreat ring option, as you have good options for activating Concentration, like Enlarge. Battlemage Setup This variation offers a gish option, where you can also spellcast with your bonus action. I do recommend stocking up on various scrolls like Scroll of Hold Monster, Scroll of Hypnotic Pattern, etc., more or less anything with illusion/enchantment school. There is an argument to be made that you could skip on Arcane Acuity​ gear (Helmet of Arcane Acuity, Gloves of Battlemage's Power) thanks to the Eldritch Strike​ effect. However, your targets will be enemies or bosses with Legendary Resistance, so to overcome them, all boosts will help. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nRhapsody\nThe recommended off-hand option if not going for shields. The Scarlet Remittance​ effect gives a nice boost to Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a whooping +3 to initiative, I would only use it without the Alert​ feat.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nReduces the critical roll requirements, giving a slight average damage boost.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe only shield that gives a boost to Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nDepending on what your priority is Helmet of Grit ensures that you can activate War Magic​ and still cast a spell with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel. \n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is an alternative option to Gloves of Battlemage's Power as both of these enable stacking Arcane Acuity. I would give priority to gloves if you are okay with Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nAlternative to the Helmet of Arcane Acuity if you take the Helmet of Grit for the additional bonus action.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nWith a crazy amount of attacks, you can use each of your hits to apply Baneful Strike​ to increase your chances of landing spells for EK and other allies.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGlove alternative if using Helmet of Arcane Acuity. These give a nice damage boost which inherits the weapon damage type.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nImproves Spell Save DC and gives a fire damage rider. This is an excellent option if you want to lean into spellcasting, but still retain damage potential.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMy go-to pick for an amulet, mandatory if you are using Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nBest offensive amulet, giving poison damage rider. You will need to get healing from another source to activate it, like a potion or a cleric's Healing Word.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThis ring option is in case you want to lean into spellcasting with scrolls to apply illusion and enchantment spells via a bonus action. This allows the Eldritch Knight to utilize its Eldritch Strike.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nVery powerful accessory that gives direct damage boost via Arcane Synergy. Use this or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The bonus depends on spellcasting modifier, so that is why Charisma is so high on the build. Debuffer Setup With this many attacks and access to already powerful weapon Shadow Blade you can do some interesting setups with Revorb setup, by utilizing gear that has Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation. Although in terms of damage, it weakens the build, it does become a unique setup."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the top Act 1 Greatswords. If you manage to get it, I recommend using Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA very good choice, has +1 Enchantment but most importantly it can use a spell that gives +2 Armour Class. Fighters don't use the Concentration slot for anything else, so the Tyr's Protection is the perfect choice.\n\n\nEverburn Blade\nThis sword is worth it until you reach Druid's Grove, there it is much better to buy items with +1 Enchantment like Greataxe +1 or Greatsword +1 as they give a better chance of landing attacks and minimal damage decrease.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above. And it becomes useless once you get Great Weapon Master.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option that will lead you through the game. Be sure to use Divine Smite on the first attack, to activate Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nGives resistance to critical hits and allows the use of Hunter's Mark, for additional single-target damage.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nAnother powerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nVery powerful armor in Act 1, that is perfect for frontliner and if you have 12 Dexterity or lower.\n\n\nChain Mail +1\nA good Heavy armor that is available early in the game.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nAs a frontliner, it will be easy to get surrounded by two enemies, so the ensured advantage is very valuable.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe +1 to attack rolls is a decent boost. Moreover, they give 18 Dexterity which is good for bonus initiative.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nVital Conduit Boots\nAs you may cast some spells with concentration these boots will give bonus survivability via temporary hitpoints.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThis is a very powerful amulet, that will lead you through most of the game, the 1d6 bonus damage is very good.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestores up to level 3 spell slot, this means that you can use it after a combat encounter to have an additional spell slot for Divine Smite.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIt's easy to activate it as you can concentrate on multiple spells in your arsenal, which will result in bonus psychic damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells."

        "Act 2 changes the landscape and there will be a lot of dark areas. For Lockadin build, specifically two-handed this whole Act will be filled with various spears, glaives, and halberds, that top one another with various bonuses and unique actions. Feel free to try them out and fully enjoy their benefits. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game. You will get it late in Act 2, but it can be a solid choice until you get the endgame weapons or Nyrulna. It is an alternative version of Selûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nVery powerful option as it can buff allies with 1d4 damage, and create difficult terrain. It is an alternative version to Shar's Spear of Evening.\n\n\nMoonlight Glaive\nHas a passive light effect, making it effective with Callous Glow Ring. Moreover, it gets bonus radiant damage and unique attack actions.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nA good choice for Act 2 and can be used till Act 3. Besides its unique benefits, it comes with bonus 1d4 force damage and not many enemies can resist it.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\n\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option that will lead you through the game. Be sure to use Divine Smite on the first attack, to activate Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nReflect 1d4 acid damage if somebody hits you in melee range.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nTruly a solid heavy armor option for a frontline. It also increases the Constitution for higher HP.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis armor is strange and very useful for the build. With it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So you could start using it once you have the Warlock subclass at level 3.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus fire damage, however, only use it once you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nA solid option as it gives a bonus 1d4 necrotic damage. But only use it after you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nThese gloves may be used by your cleric. If not, you can equip them together with Luminous Armour to apply tons of Radiating Orbs. Your Divine Smite​ attacks will be able to debuff enemies.\n\n\nGloves of the Automaton\nSimilar to the option below, these provide an Advantage on attacks but require Bonus Action to activate the effect. It would be best if you did that before combat starts. Once you get Risky Ring, drop them.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves are mandatory at least until you get Risky Ring or if you do not use Great Weapon Master feat yet.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nStill, the best amulet as it provides a substantial damage boost if healed - a cleric can do this easily.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nNot a perfect amulet, but could be useful once you have Risky Ring and other options are taken\n\n\nRings\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAllows dealing guaranteed critical hit per long rest. After this, you can just unequip it. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe bonus damage can easily stack from multiple sources. For example paladin base attack + Divine Smite.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nMakes you immune to being blinded, which can be detrimental in some encounters."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Act 3 gives so many different items, that the build can be changed multiple times as you explore it. For example, you could go with Nyrulna + Bhaalist Armour for very strong damage, but sacrificing armor class. This is the biggest damage improvement for the Lockadin build, On the other hand, you can pick Balduran's Giantslayer and take armor like Helldusk Armour or Armour of Persistence to play a more survivability role. So definitely try out different combinations to find the sweet spot for your playstyle. Moreover, spears from Act 2 - Selûne's Spear of Night and especially Shar's Spear of Evening are good weapons. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThe weapon's effectiveness comes if you will use Bhaalist Armour. When attacking obscured enemies, the bonus damage rider will also double in damage.\n\n\nNyrulna\nThis weapon can also be used as two-handed, albeit its base damage is not as high. It can be a perfect choice until you obtain the top ones. However, if you choose to use Bhaalist Armour this can be the best performer on this build.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nA good choice, specifically for Githyanki due to bonus damage and resistance. Otherwise, it falls short of other options.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nVery strong weapon, and the strongest two-hander. The only downside is that it requires you to use Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength to get the highest damage boost. Without high strength, this sword does not perform as well as other options.\n\n\nHellbeard Halberd\nThis gives a bonus of 6 poison damage per hit, which is very high, making it a strong top weapon contender.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow for crit fishing builds as it increases the critical chance.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy(BiS)\nThe best option, in terms of damage. However, this requires inflicting conditions, like negative status effects, etc.\n\n\nSarevok's Horned Helmet\nAlternative in case, you want something else. Increases critical chance, which can make your smites do crazy amounts of damage.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Persistence\nA solid defensive choice, that comes with damage reduction cantrip effects.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThe best armor for maximum damage. This is light armor, so you should be maximizing your Dexterity and have it at least at 16, to get a good Armour Class. Together with Nyrulna or Shar's Spear of Evening, you can deal frightening amounts of damage due to the Aura Of Murder​ effect. However, it may be unobtainable based on your choices in the game.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC and improves your saving throws.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nThis armor has the highest armor class in the game. Moreover, it grants flying and burns enemies in flames when they attack you.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters(BiS)\nThe best gloves for melee attacks with improved attack rolls and damage.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and provides a fire spell with Strength as a casting ability!\n\n\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThese gloves can be used to permanently increase Strength. I would recommend equipping them together with Balduran's Giantslayer.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avaoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nThe amulet still pulls strong even in the late game.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. However, this means that you will not be able to use Broodmother's Revenge for a bit more damage.\n\n\nMagic Amulet\nGives an Advantage on attack. I would use this only if you do not have Risky Ring. Otherwise, this does not provide much use, besides Saving Throw Advantage.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Regeneration\nThis ring can be used to activate Broodmother's Revenge so that you will not forget.\n\n\nRisky Ring(BiS)\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart(BiS)\nGuarantees a critical hit once per Long rest. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial. Can be equipped after Killer's Sweetheart has been used"

Another aspect is unique auras that give various buffs to you and the party. This is already powerful by itself, but let's take a look at the next class. Warlock is a caster but also can be a frontliner. The main attractiveness is its Pact of the Blade giving the ability to use Charisma as the main attack modifier instead of Strength of Dexterity. From level 5 Deepened Pact gives an additional attack per action point. Another aspect is additional spells like Hunger of Hadar giving full control of the battlefield. Warlock's spell slots also restore on short rest, but this is not a major point in my opinion.",

Otherwise, you will not use unarmed attacks with your main action, and lose a lot of damage.\n\n\nCorellon's Grace\nThis weapon gives bonus unarmed damage and also deals 1d8 damage, which is better than your fists.

To make use of it effectively, be sure to have 17 base Wisdom.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIt makes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. This greatly improves the overall survivability. I would take this only if you took Auntie Ethel's Hair +1 Wisdom.\n\n\nSentient Amulet\nThe upgraded version of the amulet is a perfect choice for a Monk.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nA perfect ring for bonus damage. It requires the enemy to be obscured, so check the stealth icon, whether the sun is half-empty or full-empty.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring effect can be activated easily by having someone cast Light​ on the monk. It does not work together with Shadow-Cloaked Ring.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armor class is a good bonus, and the ring still takes place. Weapon slot Monk can wear weapons as stat sticks and get bonuses to unarmed attacks. This becomes available once you unlock Ki Resonation: Punch​. However, you can only hit the same enemy once per turn. So, although this can increase your damage, I just don't like using this setup. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRhapsody\nSurprisingly, monks can wear melee weapons and still hit with fists. This is possible thanks to Ki Resonation: Punch​ effect. Sadly, this limits your main hand hits once per single enemy per turn. It also makes you look not like a monk, and I personally do not prefer this.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King"

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nReturning Pike\nThe only weapon you will need in Act 1-2. Although it may be boring, it will do great damage and make encounters very easy. Try to get it at levels 3-4.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above.\n\n\nShield\n-\nThe build does not need a shield in Act 1.\n\n\nHead\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat. However, this is better used on other frontliner as you are not so reliant on movement speed.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nPowerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with at least 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. It's a very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Uninhibited Kushigo\nVery powerful gloves that ensure you deal bonus damage. They will lead you through most of the playthrough.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding \nNo impact when moving on difficult terrain, this allows you to position yourself for perfect shots.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Misty Step\nDoes not require you to use Spell Slot to cast Misty Step, to either get away or reserve a better throwing position.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThe best ring for Act 1, and it will be used up until Act 3.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive, so be sure to pickpocket some traders.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. You also can get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game. You will get it late in Act 2, but it can be a solid choice until you get the endgame weapons or Nyrulna. It is an alternative version of Selûne's Spear of Night. It will not return when thrown, but depending on your Fighter subclass it may be a good choice in Act 3.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nVery powerful option as it can buff allies with 1d4 damage, and create difficult terrain. It is an alternative version to Shar's Spear of Evening. It will not return when thrown, but depending on your Fighter subclass it may be a good choice in Act 3.\n\n\nLightning Jabber\nExcellent thrown weapon, that sadly does not have return property. Still, later, when you get Eldritch Knight you can use Weapon Bond​ to make it returnable and have a solid weapon.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nReturning Pike\nStill, the best weapon to use due to return on throw.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste​ without spell slots. As Berserker, you should only do this before combat as otherwise, you waste 2 attacks.\n\n\nShield\n-\nAs the build uses two-handed weapons for Act 2, no point in using a shield for now.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIt increases the critical chance by 5%, and it only requires you to be obscured. Moreover, gives some resistance against spells by providing bonus Saving Throws.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives +1 to attack rolls. This is a minor improvement, especially as you have substantial bonuses from Tavern Brawler​ already.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nProvides a bonus critical chance while obscured. The first helmet in the game that will offer this bonus.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nWith it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So while using it, be sure to have 16 Dexterity to utilize its full potential. I think the bonus initiative is better than the Adamantine Scale Mail\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nStill plays a good role in Act 2, as its 16 Armour Class is plenty, especially if you have at least 14 Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Uninhibited Kushigo\nStill the best option until later in Act 3.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSimilar to the ones above, but changes the bonus damage to fire.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nThe only amulet that can indirectly help Berserker Tavern Brawler build by paralyzing on a critical hit.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAn alternative to the amulet above if taken by another member. Gives bonus survivability and allows casting Shield​ with reaction.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThis ring still rocks and should always be equipped.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nOne of the best rings in terms of damage, it gets a second damage instance on throws.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks, the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasily get bonus damage if creatures are illuminated, this can be done by casting Light​ on yourself by an ally, and let them stand close to the foes."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. Getting them as early as possible will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Act 3 gives so many different items, that the build can be changed multiple times as you explore it. For example: Going with Thrown weapon and Shield\nThrown weapon and Dual Wielder​ a shortsword or dagger for various bonuses\nUsing a Thrown weapon, equipping Bhaalist Armour, and going in melee range for double-throw damage. Each of these provides different options based on your risk appetite and expected damage output. Of course, the silliest and the strongest is the last one: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Weapon and Shield This is another option where you skip Dual Wielder​ feat and instead concentrate on single-handed thrown weapons and shields. This option may be picked if your other characters have taken the offhand weapons or you want to have increased survivability with bonus AC from the shield. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Main - Hand)\nNyrulna(BiS)\nI would say the simplest and most powerful pick for this build. Sadly, it comes with a caveat - area of effect thunder damage. Although this is good, it can hit allies or other friendly NPCs, sometimes creating more problems. So consider this when choosing it.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nIf you were able to acquire it, this is a compelling weapon option, but it requires you to use Weapon Bond​ so that it would return.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nAlternative to Nyrulna if you want to avoid the area of effect thunder damage. As I mentioned before you can get either this version or Shar's Spear of Evening. You will also need to Weapon Bond​ it.\n\n\nLightning Jabber\nThe lightning damage rider is still a decent damage boost. Requires Weapon Bond​ for it to return.\n\n\nDwarven Thrower\nThe best-throwing weapon if you are a dwarf. The weapon is a very good choice with its +1d8 bonus damage and further boosts against large targets.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress(BiS)\nThe strongest shield in the game. Has a special shield bash reaction that deals force damage. Moreover, gives good resistance to spells.\n\n\nSwires' Sledboard\nProvides Force Conduit each turn, decreasing the damage that the wielder receives. Dual Wielding Setup This option is if you took the Dual Wielder​ feat. The main feature while dual wielding, after you Throw​ a weapon, is that it returns to your off-hand. This seems strange, but unfortunately, that's how it works technically. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nRhapsody\nAmazing weapon that improves your damage and attack rolls for each enemy killed. The maximum bonus is +3 on each attack that you do. The best option when using the Dual Wielder​ feat. Sadly, this item is highly contested, especially by other caster builds.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nThis weapon enables double damage with its special effect. However, this requires you to hit an enemy with it. Then you are required to use melee throws. This is not a big problem even with the attack roll penalty, as you have huge bonuses from Tavern Brawler. However, this melee approach could not be for everyone. It is an alternative to Bhaalist Armour\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe perfect weapon for dual-wielding provides some damage optimization and increases critical chance range. It is not as good as the above choices but perfect for early Act 3.\n\n\nMelee (Main - Hand)\nNyrulna(BiS)\nI would say the simplest and most powerful pick for this build. Sadly, it comes with a caveat - area of effect thunder damage. Although this is good, it can hit allies or other friendly NPCs, sometimes creating more problems. So consider this when choosing it.\n\n\nLightning Jabber\nOnce you get Weapon Bond, this becomes one of the best piercing throwing weapons. What makes it special is that it has an additional lightning damage rider. Moreover, unlike Nyrulna it will not damage allies.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nAlternative to Nyrulna if you want to avoid the area of effect thunder damage. As I mentioned before you can get either this version or Selûne's Spear of Night. You will also need to Weapon Bond​ it.\n\n\nDwarven Thrower\nThe best-throwing weapon if you are a dwarf. The weapon is a very good choice with its +1d8 bonus damage and further boosts against large targets.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nAlternative to Nyrulna if you want to avoid the area of effect thunder damage. As I mentioned before, you can get either this version or Shar's Spear of Evening. You will also need to Weapon Bond​ it. Other Items The rest of the items that the build utilizes Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nThe best bow for critical increase. Overall, it is not a huge damage boost, but still more than nothing.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nProvides +3 Initiative boost, especially valuable if you did not take Alert​ feat.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit(BiS)\nThe best helmet for Berserk Thrower. The additional bonus action is a huge damage boost, but it requires you to be at 50% HP. For this reason, I recommend wearing an Amulet of Greater Health for the maximum amount of HP.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nThe bonus damage also works for unarmed attacks\n\n\nSarevok's Horned Helmet\nThe only helmet in Act 3 that provides a bonus critical chance.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until they get hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nThis is light armor, so you should be maximizing your Dexterity and have it at least at 16, to get a high Armour Class. Together with any Piercing weapon (Nyrulna, Lightning Jabber, etc.), you can deal frightening amounts of damage due to the Aura Of Murder​ effect. However, this requires you to be in melee range. Moreover, the armor could be taken by another, more relevant build in the group.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC. So you can again make sure to have it at 16.\n\n\nBonespike Garb\nProvides temporary HP and reduces incoming damage when Rage​ is active.\n\n\nUnwanted Masterwork Scalemail\nAnother option for medium armor that gives a full Armor Class boost from Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters(BiS)\nGives a solid +2 damage boost, which can be doubled if using a piercing throw weapon + Bhaalist Armour for vulnerability.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and provides a fire spell with Strength as a casting ability!\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health(BiS)\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant, as it maximizes it to 23 points.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nStill a good choice if you find it useful.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging(BiS)\nThe 1d4 bonus damage is a solid option till the end of the game.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA big damage boost as it applies twice on thrown attacks. Sadly, only activates when enemies are at least Lightly Obscured, and it does not work with Nyrulna.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Acts rings"

        "The Swords Bard, does have limitations in Act 1, and in general, it could be the best played just as a Swords Bard Archer build, until you get to level 8. Still, going with the Bardadin, setup here are my recommendations: Dual Wield Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best shortsword in Act 1, will lead you to Act 2. It gives higher critical rolls and improves damage output. Can be dual-wielded.\n\n\nShining Staver-of-Skulls\nA pretty good weapon with +1 enchantment and radiant damage rider.\n\n\nScimitar +1\nThese are the only good weapons that can be used to wear for the first part of the game.\n\n\nShortsword +1\n\n\nHunter's Dagger\nThis has a Ruptured​ effect, which can be utilized pretty well when enemies are forced to move. I would wear this in the offhand.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nImproves initiative and allows going earlier in combat. I recommend this if you plan on using Dual-wielding weapons.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nThese weapons can be dual-wielded, making them perfect very early in the game. Use this before obtaining better ones. What makes this good is that it can use bonus action for additional damage. Two-Handed Setup Weapons This is the go-to option if you want the highest damage early in the game. Before obtaining Paladin multiclass, you will be limited by weapon proficiencies. Bard by itself only has Longsword Proficiency (Phalar Aluve, Longsword +1) so wear it as 2 handed weapon. The others are added depending on your race: Githyanki - Greatsword, Humans - Pikes and Spears, and so on... Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the best greatswords that you can get in Act 1. The bonus to attack rolls is great for counteracting Great Weapon Master: All In​ Effect.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA solid greatsword, that gives bonus armour class with Shield of Faith​ action.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis sword can be very powerful, especially if you can precast one of its powerful effects. Phalar Aluve: Sing​, is an amazing buff that can also negate the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In. Otherwise, to buff your and allies' damage, utilize Phalar Aluve: Shriek. I generally recommend rushing to obtain the sword at levels 3-4.\n\n\nLongsword +1\nThe earliest good weapon that a Bard can wear before obtaining the above ones.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. \n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is an amazing weapon as you can use bonus action to break water bottles to apply wet. Other Equipment As a bard in the early game, you can only wear light armor. So just stay with it until level 3, then with Swords Bard, equip Medium Armor. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe helmet can be used to improve your weapon attacks with a spellcasting modifier.\n\n\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe circlet improves the success of your spells as long as you are obscured.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility. Only available to Dark Urge origin.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in Act 1. It will also lead you to Act 2.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\nA slight improvement due to additional bonuses. 15 Armour Class is best for now.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Perfect option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nI think these gloves are quite good for this section of the game. You get +1 Attack Rolls and a bonus to dexterity for higher initiative. They are also mandatory if you are doing natural strength setup.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nVery strong gloves as they give Advantage. It is the best way to counteract the Great Weapon Master: All In​ -5 attack roll effect.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nYou get additional Bardic Inspiration​ and an increase in Armour Class.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nGood boots that allow moving without slowing down on difficult terrain.\n\n\nVital Conduit Boots\nAs you may cast some spells with concentration these boots will give bonus survivability via temporary hit points.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThis is a very powerful amulet, that will lead you through most of the game, the 1d6 bonus damage is very good.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nThis is a great amulet, even if not worn. It can be used to restore spell slots when out of combat.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIt's easy to activate it as you can concentrate on multiple spells in your arsenal, which will result in bonus psychic damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nA good movement boost makes it easier to reach those targets."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here, and having Darkvision​ is recommended. You can also get great items, albeit many will stay the same from Act 1. Dual Wield Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nRender of Mind and Body\nThe best shortsword with Risky Ring, the 1d8 bonus damage is substantial. Moreover, by dual wielding this with Knife of the Undermountain King.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThis one still plays a big role in maximizing damage, until you get some items in Act 3.\n\n\nJusticiar's Scimitar\nAlthough more intended for assassin-type builds this is still an interesting weapon to have in the arsenal.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act. Two-Handed Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThe most powerful weapon that most of the martials can use if you will also take Bhaalist Armour in Act 3.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nA bit weaker alternative to Shar's Spear of Evening, but it is still a solid choice. Will also work well with Bhaalist Armour in Act 3.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nA significantly strong weapon with force damage rider. Moreover, it gives bonus initiative.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nOne of the core items of the build. It will ensure that any spells you use will increase Spell Save DC, once you land a few hits. Best to activate this effect with Slashing Flourish (Melee). Later on, this will synergize with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe helmet can be used to improve your weapon attacks with a spellcasting modifier.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nReflect 1d4 acid damage if somebody hits you in melee range.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nMedium armor that will reach 19 Armour class together with Gloves of Dexterity. Moreover, the bonus initiative is a great boon.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nA solid heavy armor, that can take you to Act 3 once you have Paladin multiclass.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nAmazing gloves that also give a good way to utilize a bonus action.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAdds bonus fire damage\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese gloves are excellent if you are aiming for natural strength progression, as I mentioned previously. Otherwise, I would go with the ones above if you are okay with using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nStill, the best amulet as it provides a substantial damage boost if healed - drink a potion or a cleric can do that.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nNot a perfect amulet, but could be useful once you have Risky Ring and other options are taken\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting Shield spell, can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs you have multiple cheap spells to enable concentration, this ring is very useful for a bit more damage."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible, you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. The Bardadin Build can make some crazy optimizations here, which turn the build around. One-Handed Setup In Act 3 (and late Act 2), a few rapier weapons become available, which makes it worthwhile to do a full setup around them. If you go for these, be sure to remove Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat when respeccing at Withers. You should also take Duelling​ instead of Two-Weapon Fighting, so that you would get a slight boost in damage. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nDuellist's Prerogative(BiS)\nA beautiful and deadly weapon that also gives an option to attack with a bonus action. As a piercing weapon, it benefits from Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nInfernal Rapier\nA solid weapon for a spell sword type of build. Allowing to summon a Planar Ally: Cambion.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives +3 Initiative almost guaranteeing that you go first.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nYou could use this bow as an alternative in case the other two options are taken. It gives bonus damage on critical hits. For now, this bonus works on melee attacks also and might be fixed in upcoming patches.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nDecreases the rolling requirement for Critical Hit by 1. Dual Wield Setup Weapons Act 3 showers you in some good daggers and shortswords, allowing a compelling dual-wield setup. If you go for these, be sure to remove Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat when respeccing at Withers. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nCrimson Mischief(BiS)\nThe perfect weapon for the main hand. Perfect to be used with Risky Ring. If you use Bhaalist Armour, the bonus 7 damage will become 14.\n\n\nBelm(BiS)\nUse it together with Crimson Mischief as Belm has a special effect that allows attacking with a bonus action and replicating the main hand weapon effects.\n\n\nRhapsody\nI think this is the best thing that you have equipped. It improves all the offensive stats that you need - Spell Save DC, damage, and attack rolls. Of course, the effect only applies once you kill enemies.\n\n\nRender of Mind and Body\nAs you have multiple ways of getting an Advantage, the 1d8 psychic damage rider is a very large bonus making this weapon very powerful even in Act 3.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives +3 Initiative almost guaranteeing that you go first.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nYou could use this bow as an alternative in case the other two options are taken. It gives bonus damage on critical hits. For now, this bonus works on melee attacks also and might be fixed in upcoming patches.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nDecreases the rolling requirement for Critical Hit by 1. Two-Handed Setup Weapons Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nNyrulna\nA truly powerful weapon that gives a 1d6 thunder damage bonus. Moreover, it comes with unique weapon actions that can inflict bleeding and knockback foes. This is the best weapon to use if you plan on equipping Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the top weapons if using Bhaalist Armour, the bonus damage stacks with Aura Of Murder. It's damage rider gets doubled while under auras effect.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThe strongest greatsword in the game. It gets a big damage boost from your strength modifier.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives +3 Initiative almost guaranteeing that you go first.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nIf you do not care about bonus initiative with Hellrider Longbow, this will give a decent damage boost on critical hits, which should be easy while enemies are under Hold Monster​ or Hold Person​ effect.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nImproves critical range for attack rolls. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity(BiS)\nThe best helmet for this build. It will stack up your Spell Save DC while using flourishes. Then you can cast a crowd control spell like Hold Person/Monster with 100% success. After that... just finish the enemy with guaranteed critical hits.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThe best armor if you are maximizing damage. The Aura Of Murder​ effect is deadly and will double your damage with shortswords or daggers in close range. The downside is that your Armour Class will be lower. Use this with weapons like Crimson Mischief, Nyrulna, Shar's Spear of Evening - anything that has piercing damage type.\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nExcellent armor if you will use Spirit Guardians. This way you will debuff enemies and increase the chances of them missing their attacks.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nIf you are looking for solid heavy armor, this is the one to go with. It gives a big damage reduction with Blade Ward.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nA good option for medium armor. However, I would prioritize it on a character with high Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nIf you want to maximize strength efficiently I do recommend these gloves as they will set the strength to 23. This way you simplify the build and only need to worry about Dexterity and Charisma investments.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and improves Spell Save DC, for better success of spells.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe best gloves till the end of the game, if you want to naturally pump the Strength of the build.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives an increase to attack and damage rolls of 2.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe best option, as it provides indirect bonuses to damage with Reverberation​ stacking from the conditions you apply. However, I do value the options below as they make movement on difficult terrain easier.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nAllows avoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, allowing for free movement on all terrains.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nThe amulet still pulls strong even in the late game.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. If you are doing a Strength-Based setup, this can free up the glove slot. But if you are min-maxing Gloves of Dexterity are the best choice.\n\n\nMagic Amulet\nGives an Advantage on attack. I would use this only if you do not have Risky Ring. Otherwise, this does not provide much use, besides Saving Throw Advantage.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel(BiS)\nThis is a powerful ring for Bardadin build as it allows casting enchantment and illusion spells with Bonus Action. These include Hold Person and other Crowd Control options.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nPowerful ring, that allows for increased damage when enemies are at least Lightly Obscured​.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This ring is still a good contender but could be taken by other builds.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nMentioning this accessory as it is a solid option to have in the arsenal in case, you cannot use the rings above.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial. Can be equipped after Killer's Sweetheart has been used"

        "For Act 1 you play as a standard Paladin Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nThese weapons are go-to picks if you want other options, especially for more damage. You either need high strength or Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to utilise the weapons effectively.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\n\n\nSword of Justice\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nAn excellent weapon that can be used with both dexterity and strength. It also comes with Phalar Aluve: Melody​ to apply buffs/debuffs depending on what you need in a combat situation.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nSimilar to Phalar Aluve, it can be used effectively with high Dexterity or Strength and comes with a unique area attack.\n\n\n+1 Weapon\nPurchase any +1 weapon in Druid's Grove like Greataxe +1, Greatsword +1, etc.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option in terms of bonus damage for Act 1 and Act 2.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nGives resistance to critical hits and allows the use of Hunter's Mark, for additional single-target damage.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility. Only available to Dark Urge origin.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nAnother powerful armor from Grymforge, which is a solid contender till Act 3.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThis is a medium armor version, which has slightly smaller bonuses. Still, it is a viable option.\n\n\nChain Mail +1\nEarly armor, once you get a few levels up, comes with 17 Armour Class.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Perfect option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nOne of the best picks for Natural Strength setup. This allows for maintaining high investment in Strength, Charisma, and Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies the Baneful Strike​ effect, which weakens foe saving throws, making them perfect targets for control actions or spells. This can make many bosses easier, as you can now land spells with a higher chance. For example, you can use this to make Control Undead​ or Command​ easier to land.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nIt can be used together with Divine Smite​ to weaken enemies.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and, most importantly, unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for a melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source for the main damage types.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe best ring for now in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1."

        "Shadow Blade setup At level 9, you can choose to get the Shadow Blade​ spell via Sorcerer, and use it to obtain a very powerful weapon. Later in Act 2, you can get Resonance Stone, which doubles the summoned weapon's psychic damage. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThe core item of this build, that you obtain at level 8 Eldritch Knight by learning the Shadow Blade​ spell. It is the strongest one-handed weapon, and with some optimisations, can reach ridiculous damage numbers.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nCan be used to apply the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for an additional damage rider.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nOff-hand weapon option, which improves the critical rolls range and slightly improves overall weapon damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nA very powerful shield that enables critical attack immunity.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nA decent shield with a good boost to initiative. Two Handed Setup Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nDepending on your decision on Nightsong, you will obtain one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with +2 enchantment and comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nCan be used to apply the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for additional damage rider. Other Items Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nCan be used to cast Haste on yourself before combat if possible.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nAmazing helmet, that allows you to stack Arcane Acuity​ for increased spell success chance. If you are okay with a bit less damage, but guaranteed spell success like Hold Person, this item is the best one. I would still delay equipping this one until equipping Band of the Mystic Scoundrel.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nReflect 1d4 acid damage if somebody hits you in melee range.\n\n\nArmor\nReaper's Embrace\nA very Oathbreaker-themed armor is available in late Act 2. Feel free to use it.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe medium armor gives a full dexterity armour class bonus. Moreover, the good thing is that if you use this, you can respec to Sorcerer from level 7, and enjoy Constitution Saving Throw bonuses very early, instead of waiting for Act 3 gear options.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nVery good heavy armor with good stats and replaces Adamantine Splint Armour.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Automaton\nSimilar to the option below, these provide an Advantage on attacks but require Bonus Action to activate the effect. It would be best if you did that before combat starts. Once you get Risky Ring, drop them.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus fire damage, however, only use it once you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nA solid option as it gives a bonus 1d4 necrotic damage. But only use it after you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nStill, the best amulet as it provides a substantial damage boost if healed - a cleric can do this easily.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nNot a perfect amulet, but could be useful once you have Risky Ring and other options are taken\n\n\nRings\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAllows dealing guaranteed critical hit per long rest. After this, you can just unequip it. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe bonus damage can easily stack from multiple sources. For example paladin base attack + Divine Smite.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs you have multiple cheap spells to enable concentration, this ring is very useful for a bit more damage."

        "Shadow Blade Setup You have the option of wearing either two weapons or Shadow Blade + shield. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThis continues to be your main weapon when summoned with the Shadow Blade​ spell.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nCan be used to apply the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for additional damage rider.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nRhapsody\nIn general, this would be the best weapon, as it would give a direct damage boost to all weapon attacks and improve spell success chance.\n\n\nBelm\nIt is a solid weapon option that has Perfectly Balanced Strike​ action. Now you replicate the main weapon attack. The main problem is that this conflicts with your bonus action, limiting your spellcasting options.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nExcellent weapon choice if you can guarantee critical hits. The easiest way is via Hold Monster​/Hold Person. Pair it with Vicious Shortbow for maximum damage.\n\n\nAmbusher\nCan add a necrotic damage rider on enemies that did not take a turn yet.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game with a stacked feature set and higher Armour Class.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nA mighty shield that enables critical attack immunity, greatly improving survivability.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nGives +1 Spell Save DC, for better spellcasting. Two-Handed setup Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThe best spear in terms of pure damage with Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nNyrulna\nAlternative to Shar's Spear of Evening, if you did not obtain it. The weapon has good special actions, besides its good damage.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThis is an alternative weapon in case you do not want to use the Piercing setup. The weapon wants high strength; the build setup already maximizes its damage potential.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nGithyanki's specific greatsword comes with +a 3 enchantment and special Soulbreaker​ action. Other Items Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a solid boost to initiative.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nIn terms of pure damage boost, this is the best bow, especially as you can easily guarantee critical hits via Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nAlthough this is the best bow, it is unlikely that you can use it as it is a contender for all builds. Feel free to use the ones from previous acts.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity(BiS)\nAmazing helmet, that allows you to stack arcane acuity for increased spell success chance. If you are okay with a bit less damage, but guaranteed spell success like Hold Person, this item is the best one.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nOne of the best armors in the game. The Aura Of Murder​ effect is mandatory if you are running the two-handed weapon option. It is also relevant if you have archers or throwers in your group, as they will get their damage doubled.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nThis armor has the highest armor class in the game. Moreover, it grants flying and burns enemies in flames when they attack you.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nA solid defensive choice, that comes with damage reduction cantrip effects.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nThese gloves can be used to permanently increase Strength. This means you no longer need to use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best options, especially if you can guarantee critical hits via Hold Monster​/Hold Person. Otherwise, if not using those spells extensively, I would look at other options\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives fire damage boost, and improves Spell Save DC for casting.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives a damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses a reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nGives various immunities to terrain-based effects.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nThe amulet still pulls strong even in the late game.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. However, this means that you also sacrifice an amulet slot for something that could be more offensive.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel(BiS)\nThis is a powerful ring for Sorcadin build as it allows casting enchantment and illusion spells with Bonus Action. These include Hold Person and other Crowd Control options, so be sure to utilize this together with Metamagic.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy(BiS)\nIt can be easily activated when attacking using Booming Blade.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nQuite easy to get the damage bonus as the enemies need to be at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe perfect option if you are using Shadow Blade to further increase the psychic damage.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nGuarantees a critical hit once per Long rest. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turn it into a critical."

        "The early game can be hard, as you do not know where to find items. I would like to point out that you will be using only one weapon in this act, and it is two-handed. You will also get Knife of the Undermountain King, but it will be used later in Act 2. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nWe are getting this item, to save it for Act 2, once we get access to one-handed thrown weapons. Act 1, does not have one besides Shining Staver-of-Skulls, which bonus damage does not work when thrown.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nReturning Pike\nThe only weapon you will need in Act 1. Although it may be boring, it will do some great damage and make encounters very easy.\n\n\nDoom Hammer\nDefinitely get this weapon as it can be useful against two bosses - Grym (Lv. 10) and Apostle of Myrkul, due to the blunt damage type and unique Bone Chilled​ effect.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. I recommend at least picking this up as it may be useful in Act 2 once you get Lightning Jabber.\n\n\nHead\nGrymskull Helm\nGives resistance to critical hits and allows the use of Hunter's Mark​for additional single-target damage. Perfect choice to utilize the bonus action.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat. Use it to get a better vantage point for your thrown attacks.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nVery powerful armor in Act 1, that is perfect for frontliner and if you have 12 Dexterity or lower.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nAnother powerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. It's a very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Uninhibited Kushigo\nVery powerful gloves that ensure you deal bonus damage. They will lead you through most of the playthrough.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding \nNo impact when moving on difficult terrain, this allows you to position yourself for perfect shots.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Misty Step\nDoes not require you to use Spell Slot to cast Misty Step, to either get away or reserve a better throwing position.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nI keep this amulet as a recommendation, but the reality is that it does not work with throwing. I assume this is a bug so I keep it for now.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThe best ring for Act 1, and it will be used up until Act 3.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive, so be sure to pickpocket some traders.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. You also can get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. The most prominent weapons in this act are Shar's Spear of Evening and Selûne's Spear of Night. However, you will be able to get only one of them based on one of the major decisions. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game. You will get it late in Act 2, but it can be a solid choice until you get the endgame weapons or Nyrulna. It is an alternative version of Selûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nVery powerful option as it can buff allies with 1d4 damage, and create difficult terrain. It is an alternative version to Shar's Spear of Evening.\n\n\nLightning Jabber\nUse Weapon Bond to bind this weapon and return it to you when thrown. It is an upgrade to Returning Pike, even if wearing a shield. You will use it until you can get the above spears.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nReturning Pike\nThis item should be used until you get Lightning Jabber. Then also start using a shield.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier. Still a solid option in Act 2.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste without spell slots. As Eldritch Knight, you should only do this before combat as otherwise, you waste 2 attacks.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nThe shield provides a bonus initiative that is good for starting the turns earlier.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nThe shield is still relevant especially as it gives resistance to Critical hits.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIt increases the critical chance by 5%, and it only requires you to be obscured. Moreover, gives some resistance against spells by providing bonus Saving Throws.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nProvides bonus critical chance while obscured. The first helmet in the game that will offer this bonus.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis armor is strange and very useful for the build. With it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So while using it, I recommend respeccing, so that you would have 16 Dexterity. You can lower Constitution to 14 for this if you do not use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. Another benefit is its initiative bonus, allowing you to go earlier in combat. It is useful at least until you get Alert​ feat.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe armor is still potent in Act 2, but be on the lookout for others with 19 Armour Class like Splint Armour +2.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nStill plays a good role in Act 2, as its 16 Armour Class is plenty, especially if you have at least 14 Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Uninhibited Kushigo\nStill the best option until later in Act 3.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth gloves are a good choice, they give additional necrotic damage rider.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAdds bonus fire damage rider.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nThe only amulet that can indirectly help Eldritch Knight Thrower.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAlternative to the amulet above if taken by another member. Gives bonus survivability and allows casting Shield with reaction.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThis ring still rocks and should be always equipped.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAllows dealing guaranteed critical hit per long rest. After this, you can just unequip it. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasily get bonus damage if creatures are illuminated, this can be done by casting Light on yourself by an ally."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. Getting them as early as possible will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Act 3 gives so many different items, that the build can be changed multiple times as you explore it. For example: Going with Thrown weapon and Shield\nThrown weapon and Dual Wielder​ a shortsword or dagger for various bonuses\nUsing a Thrown weapon, equipping Bhaalist Armour, and going in melee range for double-throw damage. Each of these provides different options based on your risk appetite and expected damage output. Of course, the silliest and the strongest is the last one: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening(BiS)\nAlternative to Nyrulna if you want to avoid the area of effect thunder damage. As I mentioned before you can get either this version or Selûne's Spear of Night.\n\n\nNyrulna\nAlthough this would technically be a weapon used for Throwing builds, it is perfect as a melee choice. You can still throw it for AOE lightning damage as Extra Attack​ still works. It is also ridiculously powerful if you equip Bhaalist Armour for constant vulnerability.\n\n\nDwarven Thrower\nThe best option if you are a dwarf. The bonus damage does wonders and its base damage is also the highest out of the ones listed here.\n\n\nRhapsody(BiS)\nAmazing weapon that improves your damage and attack rolls for each enemy killed. The maximum bonus is +3 on each attack that you do. The best option when dual-wielding in my opinion.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nThis weapon enables double damage with its special effect. However, this requires you to hit an enemy with it. Then you are required to use melee throws. This is not a big problem even with the attack roll penalty as you have huge bonuses from Tavern Brawler​. However, this melee approach could be not for everyone. It is an alternative to Bhaalist Armour\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe perfect weapon for dual wielding provides some damage optimization and increases critical chance range. Not as good as the above choices, but perfect for early Act 3.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nAlternative to Nyrulna if you want to avoid the area of effect thunder damage. As I mentioned before you can get either this version or Shar's Spear of Evening.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\n-\nGoing two-handed is not worth it. Sadly you gain on average just a bonus of 1 damage (1d6 vs 1d8 or 1d8 vs 1d10), which is negligible. However, if you wear a shield or second weapon the bonuses are much better.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow if you want to squeeze a little bit more damage.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nHigher initiative bonus compared to Bow of Awareness.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress(BiS)\nThe strongest shield in the game. Has a special shield bash reaction that deals force damage. Moreover, gives good resistance to spells.\n\n\nSwires' Sledboard\nProvides Force Conduit each turn, decreasing the damage that the wielder receives.\n\n\nHead\nSarevok's Horned Helmet(BiS)\nIt's the only helmet in Act 3 that provides a bonus critical chance.\n\n\nCloak\nShade-Slayer Cloak\nIf attacking from stealth (which is possible with a ranged build) increases the critical chance. However, thrown weapons sometimes do not return after a stealth attack, so it's risky (until Larian patches this)\n\n\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nIf you are into min-maxing, this is the best armor. It grants Aura Of Murder​ doubling piercing damage. However, as a ranged build, this would require you to be in close range for the effect to happen. I would recommend using this armor on another party member with melee capabilities so that you would not need to go into close range.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nThis armor has the highest armor class in the game. Moreover, it grants flying and burns enemies in flames when they attack you.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC. So you can again make sure via respec that it is 16, to get +3 to AC.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nA solid defensive choice, that comes with damage reduction cantrip effects.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves(BiS)\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and provides a fire spell with Strength as a casting ability!\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\n+ 2 bonuses to damage and attack rolls. This is perfect for increased damage and a higher chance of hit, especially at close range if you have Bhaalist Armour equipped.\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nAs the build can effectively stay in long range, you can utilize these gloves to get an additional attack each short rest, and taking a bit of damage.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, it provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health(BiS)\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. However, this means that you also sacrifice an amulet slot for something that could be more offensive.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nStill a good choice if you find it useful.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging(BiS)\nThe 1d4 bonus damage is a solid option till the end of the game.\n\n\nCaustic Band(BiS)\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. It somewhat loses its value as you can increase strength to 27 via Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength. However, it gives a huge boost to critical chance, so feel free to equip it if no group member benefits."

This is important as you may not have used for bonus action if your Sorcery points have been expended, so this will allow some bonus damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nIncreases Spell Save Difficulty Counter, while obscured. Very easy to activate, use Shift, to see the sun icon, it should be half or full empty.\n\n\nThe Lifebringer\nThe best defensive option in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler. Without it, the item loses its purpose.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best spellcaster robe in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler for additional bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws with Lightning Charges.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nApplies Reverbation when dealing thunder or lightning damage. With 5 stacks, this will deal a bonus 1d4 damage and can make enemies Prone. This can be easily achieved once you have The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nGives whooping +2 Armour Class. This is the perfect option especially if you do not have shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves that allow to negate enemy ranged attack.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nExcellent shoes for applying Reverbation. However, if you have a Cleric or other Spirit Guardians​ user I would save these on them.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives additional protection against being Prone.\n\n\nAmulet\nPsychic Spark\nExcellent amulet which improves Magic Missile​ effectiveness, making it one of the best spells in the early game.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nA good amulet that allows restoring level 3 or lower spell slots. This way you could get additional sorcery points.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nA good amulet to obtain mobility via Misty Step.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows Casting invisibility for free once per long rest.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells works with 5 Reverbation stacks from Boots of Stormy Clamour."

Be sure to equip a second, hand crossbow like Hand Crossbow +1.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nStill the best bow, as initiative plays a vital role for first mover advantage during encounters.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nCan be useful to precast Haste​ in some encounters.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nSame armor from Act 1 that improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nGives bonus Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThe best gloves in terms of stacking bonus Reverbation, especially via Callous Glow Ring effect.\n\n\nHr'a'cknir Bracers\nDecent gloves with the ability to cast Telekinesis.\n\n\n-\nAnything from Act 1.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThey are still the best boots for applying various conditions.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nSlightly improves Armour Class resulting in a higher survivability.\n\n\nAmulet\n-\nPrevious Act Amulets.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nThe Shield​ spell is pretty good, but you will get this spell from a Sorcerer.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nAllows restoring any level of spell slot.

The Radiating Orb effect will debuff enemies, making it harder for them to hit targets."

Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nWoe\nVampiric staff with improvements to Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat.

Enemies walking through icy terrain risk slipping prone, potentially wasting their turn and losing valuable movement.

Before you unlock Paladin, you will not have proficiency in it, so use it as a stat stick.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nExcellent shield with immunity to critical hits and a debuff on enemies via Reeling. You will not be able to wear it before you unlock Paladin.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThe best helmet for this build that allows to quickly build up Arcane Acuity​ using weapon attacks.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAlternative headwear to activate Arcane Synergy​ via Booming Blade​ weapon attack.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nOne of the best-looking armours, and great options for maximizing spell concentration. You will obtain either of these depending on the Act 2 major decision regarding Nightsong.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nPotent Robe\nIn terms of damage potential, this is the best armour option as it will add more damage to Booming Blade. However, this also greatly reduces your armour class.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nExcellent medium armor that has full scaling from Dexterity ability modifier.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nAlternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity to stack Arcane Acuity.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boot choice for moving on any kind of terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nAvoids Prone​ effect while you are concentrating on spells.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe best ring in terms of direct damage improvement. Use Booming Blade​ to activate Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nThese rings serve the same purpose and give a slight damage boost. The main difference is that Strange Conduit Ring requires concentration, which you might not have on the first turn as you build up Arcane Acuity​. On the other hand, Shadow-Cloaked Ring is limited by where you are doing combat, and the enemy has to be at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\n\n\nRing of Protection\nDefensive ring for a slight armour class boost."

Use a level 5 spell slot to summon the highest damage with Shadow Blade.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Handed)\nRhapsody\nOne of the best off-hand stat stick weapons, which has Scarlet Remittance​ effect for stacking Spell Save DC and damage.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nSlightly boosts weapon damage, best used as a stat stick.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nA very powerful shield that enables critical attack immunity.\n\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nHas one of the highest armour class values, and provides useful special actions against attacking enemies.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThe straight-up best headwear for stacking Arcane Acuity​ and pumping up that spell save DC.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAlternative headwear, in case the other one is not available. If wearing this, do not use Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves chances of avoiding attacks from enemies, in turn activating Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverberation, this cloak will make it easy to activate its effect.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Agility\nIn terms of defensive capabilities, this is the best armour pick.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nIf you have an archer, this armour is the best pick to apply Aura Of Murder​ to weaken enemies.\n\n\nPotent Robe\nIn terms of pure damage, this is the best pick, but it greatly diminishes your Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThe best gloves pick, which sets strength to 23, making this the main stat for Shadow Blade.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nAnother glove alternative with a solid damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nAlternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity in case you don't have access to it.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nThese are the best boot choices in the game, allowing you to safely walk on most of the dangerous surfaces.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives a direct damage boost when healed.

        "Act 1 is pretty generous with weapon options, so choose based on what you prefer: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nGives a very easy advantage option, greatly increasing hit chance.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the best early game weapons with a boost to attack rolls against enemies that have already received damage.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nExcellent sword, which has a powerful Razor Gale​ action, easily hitting multiple foes in its cone.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA solid greatsword option with special shield action.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear for pure weapon damage increase. Can be replaced with Ring of Arcane Synergy if needed.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nOne of the best Heavy armor choices, with solid Armour Class, Reeling​ debuff, and damage reduction.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe starting armor that is surprisingly good is worn by Lae'zel. It gets +2 Armor Class from at least 14 Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nOne of the best picks if you are doing a Natural Strength setup. This allows for a reduction of Dexterity investment to 8, and puts other points into Constitution or Wisdom.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies the Baneful Strike​ effect, which weakens foe saving throws, making them perfect targets for control actions or spells. This can make many bosses easier, as you can now land spells with a higher chance.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nLinebreaker Boots\nCan work well with Expeditious Retreat​ on the initial turn to get Wrath​ stacks. However, I would not use it very often, as it can interfere with the Great Weapon Master: Bonus Attack​ effect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source, for the mid-game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nUse this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy to get the Arcane Synergy​ effect. Booming Blade​ is the easiest option of activating it.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nDepending on your decision on Nightsong, you will obtain one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nCharge-Bound Warhammer\nA solid weapon that gets an additional damage rider and an enchantment bonus with Weapon Bond.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with a +2 enchantment comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Act weapons still play a decent role and can be used effectively.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nComes with elemental resistances and free Haste​.\n\n\n-\nBows from previous Acts.\n\n\nHead\n-\nPrevious Act headwear\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA semi-upgrade to Adamantine Splint Armour with a boost to Constitution and AC, but lower damage reduction.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nYou will want to wear these gloves if you are using the Natural Strength setup, to invest dexterity points into Constitution.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nUse this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy to get the Arcane Synergy​ effect.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives psychic damage rider while you are concentrating on a spell. This can be anything, like Protection from Evil and Good​ or Enlarge​\n\n\nCaustic Band\nTrusty ring option with flat +2 damage boost.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you have a hard time getting Advantage on your attacks, this is the easiest fix, although it comes with a disadvantage on mental saves.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks."

        "If you have been running Elixir of Hill Giant Strength with 8 strength, your direct upgrade is Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength for 23 strength. If you did the Natural Strength setup, you would want to maximize your Dexterity, and to do this, you either use Gloves of Dexterity or Amulet of Greater Health. The amulet is used to funnel all points from Constitution into Dexterity. So you end up with high strength, constitution, dexterity, and intelligence. Without those two items, the build ends up not as well optimized Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThe best spear in terms of pure damage with Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nNyrulna\nAlternative to Shar's Spear of Evening, if you did not obtain it. The weapon has good special actions, besides its good damage.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThis is an alternative weapon in case you do not want to use the Piercing setup. The weapon wants high strength; the build setup already maximizes its damage potential.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nGithyanki's specific greatsword comes with +a 3 enchantment and special Soulbreaker​ action.\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nIn terms of pure damage boost, this is the best bow, especially as you can easily guarantee critical hits via Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a whooping +3 to initiative, I would only use it without the Alert​ feat.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nReduces the critical roll requirements, giving a slight average damage boost.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThe best option in terms of combat damage potential. The additional bonus action can be utilized both with War Magic​ and Great Weapon Master: Bonus Attack​ effects. This does require you to have HP at less than 50% and you must wear Amulet of Greater Health or have a good investment in Constitution.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn case the Ring of Arcane Synergy is taken, and you want to avoid using Helmet of Grit this is the most relevant option.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nA powerful spellsword setup option, making each of your weapon attacks give 2 stacks of Arcane Acuity.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nA good helmet with a flat necrotic damage rider on weapon attacks.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nThe best cloak in terms of defensive capabilities, as it gives the enemy a disadvantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nThe best armour in terms of combat damage potential. This gives Aura Of Murder​ a doubling of damage of all piercing attacks. Even if you do not use these weapons, your archers can benefit from this effect.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nAn alternative heavy armour that also gives Blade Ward​ to reduce incoming damage.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe only option to wear if you would like to negate critical hits from the enemies. This greatly improves survivability, especially when you are running Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nAllows you to just skip any strength investment and continue point investment into spellcasting modifier.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nOne of the best offensive gloves, giving a decent damage boost, which gets doubled if you use Bhaalist Armour + a piercing weapon, as the damage bonus type is inherited from the weapon.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nImproves Spell Save DC and gives a fire damage rider. This is an excellent option if you want to lean into spellcasting, but still retain damage potential.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese gloves are an option if you will go with natural strength, and will not use or have access to the Amulet of Greater Health yet.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nBoth of these are some of the best boots in the game. Use any of these to improve your movement on various terrains and avoid negative effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMy go-to pick for an amulet, mandatory if you are using Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nBest offensive amulet, giving poison damage rider. You will need to get healing from another source to activate it, like a potion or a cleric's Healing Word.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nVery powerful accessory that gives direct damage boost via Arcane Synergy. Use this or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The bonus depends on spellcasting modifier, so that is why Intelligence is so high on the build.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nExcellent ring that easily gives a damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThis ring option is in case you want to lean into spellcasting with scrolls to apply illusion and enchantment spells via a bonus action. This allows the Eldritch Knight to utilize its Eldritch Strike.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGreat ring option, as you have good options for activating Concentration, like Enlarge."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nSorrow\nCan use Sorrowful Lash​ to pull enemies together and make it easy to land Horde Breaker.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nIt can be used as a stat stick and dual-wielded.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nUse this together with Titanstring Bow if you skip on Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. This will be a good +4 damage boost on all shots.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nIn terms of pure damage, this bow is the top option for the whole game. Use either Club of Hill Giant Strength or Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to maximize your damage.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nThis bow can be deadly with Gloves of Baneful Striking for frightening enemies and increasing your damage.\n\n\nHarold\nA decent ranged weapon option, that applies Bane​ and weakens enemy saving throws.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a Reeling​ effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from the priestess in the Goblin camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe headwear can be a significant damage boost.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, which is great for better positioning to land your shots.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nIt can be a useful helmet for its bonuses and access to Hunter's Mark​ for Act 1.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nTo be fair, I would be indifferent to which armor you pick. But the heavy one does give higher bonuses, and you have proficiencies to wear them.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\nThe best starter medium armor. You can just take it from Lae'zel, or get the Scale Mail +1 if the other one is not accessible.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Archery\nYour ranged attacks deal an additional 2 damage, one of the best options for early game gloves.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies Baneful Strike,​ weakening enemies for other actions and spells to have a higher success chance.\n\n\nGloves of Power\nApplies Bane​ effect, which does come with a caveat, enemies need ot fail a saving throw, and the effect is not guaranteed. \n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nIn terms of offensive potential, these are the best boots. However, I would prioritize them on a Cleric if you have one in the party. Otherwise, this is best used with Arrow of Many Targets.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game, giving easy traversal options and avoiding any difficult terrains and their effects.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nSimple yet effective boots, allowing you to avoid attacks of opportunity.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best amulets in the game. You can just drink a Potion of Healing and get its benefit.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nUsing a bonus action, you can weaken a foe and deal double damage with your weapon.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a significant damage boost, as long as you have a spell with Concentration, this can even be Hunter's Mark.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed for better positioning."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nSame as Act 1\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nObtain this weapon as it is one of the best options for buffing yourself with fire damage via Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nContinues to be the best bow in the game.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it, you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply control over key enemies.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Acts shields.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nContinues to be a solid headwear option for higher damage.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives an additional attack roll bonus, and works perfectly with ranged weapons if you decide to use them.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA solid armor, with high Armour Class, and other relevant bonuses.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in Act 2. With high dexterity, it can have the highest Armour Class of all gear options in this stage of the game.\n\n\nGloves\nThermoarcanic Gloves\nThe best gloves if you plan on using the Heat Convergence​ mechanic to buff your fire damage riders from the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ buff with Drakethroat Glaive.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nExcellent glove picks that have fire damage and are excellent for use with Oil of Combustion.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves give 1d4 necrotic damage boost. The upper ones also come with an additional effect.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nIn terms of offensive potential, these are the best boots. However, I would prioritize them on a Cleric if you have one in the party. Otherwise, this is best used with Arrow of Many Targets.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost. However, it will interfere with other coatings like Oil of Combustion, so I would not use it together.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet for Honour Mode runs, reducing your chances of wiping.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGrants additional damage to obscured enemies.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAn easy source of additional psychic damage. You can get concentration from Guidance, casting it before combat. It also works well with Resonance Stone for double damage.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThe ring is an excellent option when you would like to have an advantage without any worries, to maintain a high hit chance.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nThe ring can be useful if your party utilizes the Darkness​ spell and related mechanics.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks."

        "The main setup options here lie in what you wear in your melee slots. These items will be your stat sticks, so they can improve damage, survivability, etc. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRhapsody\nPlenty of options here to wield. Rhapsody is overall the best weapon as stat stick, but is in high demand by almost any build. Club of Hill Giant Strength is useful with Titanstring Bow if not using Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength. The others are also great stat sticks, giving either a critical damage boost or a crit range increase.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\n\n\nDolor Amarus\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role, giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nContinues to be the best bow. For Act 3, you can chug Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength for even more bonus damage or continue using Club of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nGontr Mael\nAn alternative Bow, that looks very cool and does decent damage. It also applies bonus Radiant damage.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nThis can be an extremely deadly bow if you have a way in the party to guarantee critical hits. This can be done with paralyzing effects like Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nHarold\nIn my opinion, continues to be the best option for crossbows with its Bane​ debuff.\n\n\nHellfire Engine Crossbow\nA +2 enchantment crossbow, that is pretty solid option for pure damage.\n\n\nFabricated Arbalest\nSadly, you obtain it quite late, and it has buggy interactions. It's special action, Illuminating Shot,​ does not work with Sharpshooter: All In, so deactivate it. The Dazzling Ray​ uses Spell Save DC for its success, which also limits its full potential.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nThe lower priority bow, in case you do not have access to the ones above.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best headwear for the build, giving a damage boost via Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nThis armor would be the highlight of the build, as it doubles piercing damage with Aura Of Murder. This does require you to stand close to foes, but the huge damage boost is just too good to pass up. Moreover, another melee character can wear it and leave you to stay in a ranged distance.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nTo be fair, besides Bhaalist Armour, you can use anything that looks cool or imposing. The build has huge bonuses to dexterity, all armor proficiencies, so take anything that fancies you.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nGloves\nThermoarcanic Gloves\nThe best gloves if you plan on using the Heat Convergence​ mechanic to buff your fire damage riders from the Draconic Elemental Weapon​ buff with Drakethroat Glaive.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives a fire damage rider, which allows for easy detonation of Oil of Combustion.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nSolid gloves that boost weapon damage and improve attack rolls.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are an exception as they have a buggy mechanic of doubling damage instances on crit hits. This can result in some ridiculous damage if your party has a member who can apply Hold Person​/Hold Monster​ for a 100% crit chance.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe Boots of Stormy Clamour would be the best option, but they are contested, especially by clerics. If you have one in the party, go for any other recommendation or even the ones from previous acts.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost. However, it will interfere with other coatings like Oil of Combustion, so I would not use it together.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nA great amulet, especially if you are using Risky Ring or Resonance Stone to negate the disadvantage.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nGreat amulet, but as a ranged character with full HP and not many concentration spells, I would not worry about prioritizing it.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGrants additional damage to obscured enemies.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAn easy source of additional psychic damage. You can get concentration from Guidance, casting it before combat. It also works well with Resonance Stone for double damage.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThe ring is an excellent option when you would like to have an advantage without any worries, to maintain a high hit chance.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nThe ring can be useful if your party utilizes the Darkness​ spell and related mechanics."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2. Sunbeam​ is also a powerful spell to get this early in the game.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody​ before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nStaff of Arcane Blessing\nThis works together with The Whispering Promise and healing spells. What this staff gives is an additional 1d4 to rolls on spell attacks - Inflict Wounds, Chromatic Orb, etc. So it's useful if you have other casters around\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives an easy advantage against Monstrosity-type enemies.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a Reeling​ effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from True Soul Priestess Gut (Lv. 4) in Goblin Camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any Reverberation​ effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor pick, for most of the game, later you will get more options, for the necrotic theme.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverberation​ stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet in the early game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs to your allies.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Healing Word​ or Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from the Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability. This improves the chances of activating the Holy Lance Helm\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nGives +1 damage boost on 5 Reverberation​ stacks detonation."

This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC, improving spell success. This is not a hugely important item, so you can give this to another caster and continue using the previous act gear.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverberation,​ this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.

Sadly, this does not create a separate instance if you use Spirit Guardians,​ so no additional Radiating Orb​ stacks. Still, it gives +2 damage on each enemy tag, and can be used with necrotic Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds a Dazed​ effect that can be proc after 5 Reverberation​ stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

For now, you do not have many options for dealing Thunder, Lightning, or Radiant Damage. However, if you get Spirit Guardians and can cast two spells with Metamagic: Quickened Spell​ you will see some interesting combos. Moreover, these gloves are extremely useful if you decide to go with Lightning Bolt.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGloves specific for Bard, allowing to gain one more Bardic Inspiration charge.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nDefensive gloves that can improve Armour Class especially if you don't have Shield Proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Cinder and Sizzle\nThese gloves are an interesting choice.

This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough.\n\n\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nThis crossbow can cast Scorching Ray each Short Rest. So you can try using it with Hat of Fire Acuity to stack Spell Save DC before obtaining a level 3 Sorcerer.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nStill a solid choice, especially if you only need initiative.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield there is for a caster.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nHead\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThis is the best helmet for most of the game.

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. There are two main setups that I see, that I would like to cover with weapons: Now, for the other equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best staff in the game. You can use it to activate Bolts of Doom for Lightning Charge stacking, Chain Lightning, or Lightning Bolt. Or you could take Bone-shaking Thunder for even more Reverbation stacking. Moreover, you get Arcane Battery for free spell cast up to level 6.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nUse this one in an off-hand. It has an Arcane Battery, allowing you to cast a spell for free. Moreover, it improves spell attack rolls.\n\n\nStaff of the Emperor\nGives bonus Spell Save DC and spell attack rolls. Moreover, its unique effect allows you to Stun enemies if you succeed in a Saving Throw against their effects.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nHead\nHat of Fire Acuity(BiS)\nThe best headwear until the late game. Use Scorching Ray while wearing it, to stack Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nIf for some reason you were not able to obtain Hat of Fire Acuity this is a good alternative that gives a good stat boost for spellcasters.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImprove Spell Save DC by one, the best option for a direct increase in build effectiveness.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverbation, this cloak is amazing and allows Dazing enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nArmor\nRobe of the Weave(BiS)\nThe best clothing for caster. Not only improves spellcasting but also provides +2 Armour Class.\n\n\nMoon Devotion Robe\nThis armor can combo well with Gloves of Belligerent Skies to apply reverbation. It also has Constitution saving throw proficiency ensuring that your spells stay active even if hit.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThe best gloves if using the Spirit Guardians option. If not, check the options below\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese give improved spell attack rolls and Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, that also gives a level 3 Command spell each Long Rest, synergizing well with Bard Sorcerer Build.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe best boots to use with the build\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout(BiS)\nThe Best amulet for this build. However, if you have a cleric, I would say it is better used on it.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring(BiS)\nThe best ring for bonus damage and reverbation stacking.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition(BiS)\nProvides an easy way to apply Mental Fatigue with spells."

You will still have to attack with the weapon for the main hand and use bonus actions to attack with fists. I only recommend using this until you get the first gloves with bonus damage, like Gloves of Cinder and Sizzle. After that just use unarmed attacks.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best helmets that gives a substantial damage increase based on the spellcasting modifier. For monks it is Wisdom.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nOne of the best cloaks for Assassin-type builds. You can now become invisible after killing an enemy, being able to lunge on your foe with advantage the next turn.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nOne of the best armors for this build throughout the whole game.\n\n\nInfernal Robe\nExcellent robe in the early game, however, requires to make a very unpopular action.\n\n\n-\nBefore that use any kind of robe.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Sparkle Hands\nAmazing gloves that after the first hit will give Lightning Charges. These then provide bonus 1 damage lightning and can stack up with more Lightning Charges.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nThe +2 Armour class is a big boost especially if you do not have a shield proficiency.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet\nGreat amulet that will be useful for most of the game. With its actions, it is the perfect choice for Monk.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nOne of the best rings for melee martials in the early game."

Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRender of Mind and Body\nOnce you start using Shadow Blade Ring, this weapon can be equipped with the main hand. Once you summon Shadow Blade it will move to offhand, which you then can attack with using bonus action.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear in terms of damage.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nAnother option, that gives a little damage boost via increased crit range. Fits perfectly for the assassin theme.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nStill a solid cloak option, due to its inherent invisibility feature.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nBoth of these are good armor choices, mainly because they come with an advantage on constitution saving throws. They also allow getting stealth advantage without any penalties.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nThe clothing is still the best one, especially if you do not have medium armor proficiency. However, once you obtain Resonance Stone and start using the Shadow Monk build, take a look at the next suggestions.\n\n\nMoon Devotion Robe\nOne of the robes that you can use to obtain a Constitution Saving Throw advantage once you start using Shadow Blade.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nExcellent gloves that give a powerful bonus action.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nThe gloves give fire damage rider, which widens the damage rolls.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nStill one of the best boots to use. It's important to make sure that you don't fall on ice or get affected by other terrain statuses.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nAs you will be concentrating on Shadow Blade, the effect will also persist.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nShadow Blade Ring\nThis is the key item to make the build work. Without it, I would go for another setup.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nBeing able to see in magical Darkness​ is great if you are utilizing its effects. If you are not using it, then I would skip this ring.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring will prove useful once you start using Shadow Blade​ with Resonance Stone. The 1d4 damage will get doubled."

The additional damage will be turned into psychic type.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA bit inferior stat stick, that rerolls low damage rolls and increases crit range.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nProvides a little bit of overall damage increase via crit range.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nStill the best headwear to use.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe best mantle to use with the Invisibility effect.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nEnsures good survivability, by imposing a disadvantage on attacker Attack Rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nRobe of Supreme Defences\nThis is the best option in terms of maintaining Shadow Blade​ and also getting bonus AC. However, it does not provide a Stealth checks advantage, so you will have to get it elsewhere. This clothing is best used if you are playing the build more like a general martial and not a stealth one.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nBoth of these are good armor choices, mainly because they come with an advantage on constitution saving throws. They also allow getting stealth advantage without any penalties.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nContinues to be a solid pick, even in the late game with stealth ability check advantage and +2 Dexterity.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nWith the +2 Saving Throw bonus and no penalty to stealth, this is a decent armor option.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nThe best gloves for martial builds, with bonuses to damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nAlternative gloves, that provide 1d6 fire damage rider.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nOne of the best late game boots\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nThe best amulet for this build in my opinion. It will fully address the problems of losing concentration while having Shadow Blade​ active.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nGives an advantage on mental ability checks. This is useful to counteract the Resonance Stone effects.\n\n\nRings\nShadow Blade Ring\nThis is the key item to make the build work. Without it, I would go for another setup.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nBeing able to see in magical Darkness​ is great if you are utilizing its effects. If you are not using it, then I would skip this ring.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring will prove useful once you start using Shadow Blade​ with Resonance Stone. The 1d4 damage will be doubled."

        "The early game can be hard, as you do not know where to find items. You also should make a decision, about what kind of setup you are going with - Two-Handed or One-Handed. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThe best one-handed weapon option in Acts 1 and 2. Gives +3 Enchantment and very powerful Sunbeam action.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nThis weapon is also a contender for best one-handed weapon in Act 1, as it has a unique Razor Gale effect, allowing it to hit multiple targets.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nA perfect one-handed option. Its special Shriek ability will also give a huge boost to other party members. However, I would better use this with Cleric as the activation costs an action and the result is two lost attacks.\n\n\nSword of Screams\nA solid weapon, that gives a bonus 1d4 psychic damage each hit.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nSoulbreaker Greatsword\nThis weapon is mostly useful if you are playing as Githyanki as they gain additional 1d4 psychic damage. Of course, the weapon is good by itself as it gives Soulbreaker action and higher initiative.\n\n\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA very good choice, has +1 Enchantment but most importantly it can use a spell that gives +2 Armour Class. Fighters don't use the Concentration slot for anything else, so the Tyr's Protection is the perfect choice.\n\n\nEverburn Blade\nThis sword is worth it until you reach Druid's Grove, there it is much better to buy items with +1 Enchantment like Greataxe +1 or Greatsword +1 as they give a better chance of landing attacks and minimal damage decrease.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best option in terms of damage. It is relevant to most of the game for Battlemaster. However, I would not rely heavily on this as you are the most powerful while using Melee weapons.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above. And it becomes useless once you get Great Weapon Master.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nGrymskull Helm\nGives resistance to critical hits and allows the use of Hunter's Mark, for additional single-target damage.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nGreat helmet, that can deal bonus damage to attacking targets. Be sure to have a high Armour Class to avoid enemy hits\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nVery powerful armor in Act 1, that is perfect for frontliner and if you have 12 Dexterity or lower.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nAnother powerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese gloves set your Dexterity to 18, allowing you to respec and dump it to 8. You can then maximize Constitution and other abilities like Wisdom, and Charisma to work better against spells.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nTruly the best option in Act 1, as this will guarantee that your attacks land.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives additional protection against being Prone.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThis is a very powerful amulet, that will lead you through most of the game, the 1d6 bonus damage is very good.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in the Act 1.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. We also can get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThis still plays a major role in Act 2, even more so as its light effect helps with combat in the Darkness.\n\n\nMyrkulite Scourge\nDeals bonus necrotic damage.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nA late Act 2 weapon, that deals a lot of damage, and has a unique Darkness effect. It also deals 1d6 bonus damage to obscured targets.\n\n\nMoonlight Glaive\nHas a passive light effect, making it effective with Callous Glow Ring. Moreover, it gets bonus radiant damage and unique attack actions.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nA good choice for Act 2 and can be used till Act 3. Besides its unique benefits, it comes with bonus 1d4 force damage and not many enemies can resist it.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best option in terms of damage, is through most of the game for Battlemaster. However, I would not rely heavily on this as you are the most powerful while using Melee weapons.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nThe shield provides a bonus initiative that is good for starting the turns earlier.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nThe shield is still relevant especially as it gives resistance to Critical hits.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIt increases the critical chance by 5%, and it only requires you to be obscured. Moreover, gives some resistance against spells by providing bonus Saving Throws.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nProvides bonus critical chance while obscured.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nReflect 1d4 acid damage if somebody hits you in melee range.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis armor is strange and very useful for the build. With it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So while using it, I recommend respeccing, so that you would have 16 Dexterity. You can lower Constitution to 14 for this as you do not need it for spell concentration. Another benefit is its initiative bonus, allowing you to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe armor is still potent in Act 2, but be on the lookout for others with 19 Armour Class like Splint Armour +2.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nStill plays a good role in Act 2, as its 16 Armour Class is plenty.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Automaton\nSimilar to the option below, these provide an Advantage on attacks but require Bonus Action to activate the effect.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves are mandatory at least until you get Risky Ring or if you do not use Great Weapon Master feat yet.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus fire damage, however, only use it once you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nA solid option as it gives a bonus 1d4 necrotic damage. But only use it after you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armour class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nStill the best amulet as it provides a substantial damage boost if healed - a cleric can do this easily.\n\n\nRings\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAllows dealing guaranteed critical hit per long rest. After this, you can just unequip it. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasily get bonus damage if creatures are illuminated, this can be done by casting Light on yourself by an ally.\n\n\nRing of Free Action\nMakes you immune to difficult terrain, and you cannot be paralyzed otherwise.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nMakes you immune to being blinded, which can be detrimental in some encounters."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Act 3 gives so many different items, that the build can be changed multiple times as you explore it. For example you could go with Nyrulna + Bhaalist Armour for very strong damage, but sacrificing armour class. On the other hand, you can pick Balduran's Giantslayer and take armor like Helldusk Armour or Armour of Persistence to play a more survivability role. So definitely try out different combinations to find the sweet spot for your playstyle. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nNyrulna(BiS)\nAlthough this would technically be a weapon used for Throwing builds, it is perfect as a melee choice. You can still throw it for AOE lightning damage as Extra Attack​ still works. It is also ridiculously powerful if you equip Bhaalist Armour for constant vulnerability.\n\n\nBelm\nWhat makes this one special is that it has a unique Whirlwind attack, that can target all nearby enemies with separate attack rolls. You can easily do three smites on different targets with it. It has another effect when worn in an offhand, you can use it as a bonus action attack which replicates the main hand weapon.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nAlthough the weapon is aimed at single-wielding without a shield, it is still useful as it allows additional attack using bonus action.\n\n\nDevotee's Mace\nDeals 1d8 bonus radiant damage and has +3 enchantment to damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nBalduran's Giantslayer(BiS)\nThe best two-handed sword in the game. Gives huge damage bonuses from high strength and is a perfect large monster killer.\n\n\nNyrulna\nThis weapon can also be used as two-handed, albeit its base damage is not as high. It can be best in slot weapon if you use Bhaalist Armour for constant vulnerability. Otherwise, go for the above one.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nA good choice, specifically for Githyanki due to bonus damage and resistance. Otherwise, it falls short of other options.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nA strong contender for Act 3. The unique Darkness effects make it an easy way to get an advantage and make enemies blind. Enemy attacks will also have problems reaching you. You can double its damage with Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nHellbeard Halberd\nThis gives a bonus of 6 poison damage per hit, which is very high.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow for crit fishing builds as it increases the critical chance.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress(BiS)\nThe strongest shield in the game. Has a special shield bash reaction that deals force damage. Moreover, gives good resistance to spells.\n\n\nSwires' Sledboard\nProvides Force Conduit each turn, decreasing the damage that the wielder receives.\n\n\nHead\nHelm of Balduran\nOptimal choice to ensure high survivability. Gives various bonuses and makes you immune to stuns and criticals.\n\n\nMask of Soul Perception(BiS)\nThe best helmet to increase attack chance success when using Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nIncreases attack rolls and provides a bit more damage with weapons. just be sure to not have your HP at maximum, make an ally hit you before the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nHelldusk Armour(BiS)\nThis armor has the highest Armour Class in the game. Moreover, it grants flying and burns enemies in flames when they attack you.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nThis is light armor, so you should be maximizing your Dexterity and have it at least at 16, to get a high Armour Class. Together with Nyrulna you can deal frightening amounts of damage due to the Aura Of Murder​ effect. However, this requires some special in-game decisions to obtain this armor.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nA solid defensive choice, that comes with damage reduction cantrip effects.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC. So you can again make sure via respec that it is 16, to get +3 to AC.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves(BiS)\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and provides a fire spell with Strength as a casting ability!\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\n+ 2 bonuses to damage and attack rolls. Which is perfect when using Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nGauntlets of the Warmaster\nBattle Master-specific gloves, that give an enemy disadvantage against your Maneouvres.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avaoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nThe amulet still pulls strong even in the late game.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMakes any kind of Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. However, this means that you also sacrifice an amulet slot for something that could be more offensive.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring(BiS)\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nGuarantees a critical hit once per Long rest. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical."

        "This part of the game can be tough for Bard. If you are Githyanki, be sure to get Medium Armour, as it is the best option before you can get one of those mentioned in the list. Another option, be sure to equip a Shield if you can. Another important aspect, to make the build work early on, is to cast Mage Armour​ by an ally. This will give +3 Armour Class if you are wearing a clothing. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThis is the best item that you can use in Act 1. It improves your spell success chance.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe best headwear in Act 1. Just be sure to be obscured if you can.\n\n\nCap of Curing\nThe restored health is a good bonus when you use up Bardic Inspiration.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility. Only available to Dark Urge origin.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nBest clothing for caster in Act 1.\n\n\nBlazer of Benevolence\nBard item, that gives bonus HP after Bardic Inspiration use.\n\n\nGloves\nHellrider's Pride\nThese gloves are amazing for Mass Healing Word​ setup. It will decrease damage from physical sources by half.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGloves specific for Bard, allowing to gain one more Bardic Inspiration charge.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nThese are the best early-game gloves, giving you a +2 Armour class if you are not using a shield.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese will be the best boots you use throughout the game. Each time you apply a condition, Reverbation stacks will apply, for further increased success of melee actions and some spells. 5 stacks will deal thunder damage.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nThis is a good amulet before you get some use for bonus action. Use it, to apply vulnerabilities that your martials can exploit.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestore up to level 3 spell slot. Can be unequipped after use.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nBe sure to get this ring, as it will be an extremely powerful addition once you start using the Mass Healing Word​ setup.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Sparkswall\nA great ring that gives resistance to lightning damage.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed, but most likely this will be used by your melee party members."

        "Act 2 changes the landscape and there will be a lot of dark areas. Moreover, it will provide some amazing items for you to find, that will improve the build setup. The main change is that once you hit level 6, you can drop Hand Crossbow +1 and use Mass Healing Word​ with bonus action. This opens up other ranged item options, so be sure to check them. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThe staff is still the best contender for Act 2 as it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nStill a solid choice, especially if you only need initiative.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield there is for a caster.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nImproves spell success chance and increases the likelihood of going first.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverbation, this cloak is amazing and allows Dazing enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nStill the best option even in Act 2. This requires Lightning Charges, to unlock full potential.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nAnother robe that gives +1 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nHellrider's Pride\nThese gloves are amazing for Mass Healing Word​ setup. It will decrease damage from physical sources by half.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots are the best option due to the Reverbation stacking.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nYou can use this amulet together with healing items - Hellrider's Pride and The Whispering Promise to apply buffs and save spell slots.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting Shield spell, can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nBe sure to get this ring, as it will be an extremely powerful addition once you start using the Mass Healing Word​ setup.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nAny of your control spells that enemies will fail now also incur Mental Fatigue.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nAn easy way to get bonus Armour Class in Act 2."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. The best pick here is taking Dual Wielder​ and equipping two staves for improved Spell Save DC. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best staff in the game. Of course, better use this on offensive caster if you have. Otherwise, Kereska's Favour is an amazing action. I recommend taking Bone-Shaking Thunder (for Reverbation) or Bolts of Doom (for powerful Lightning Spells).\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nIt has an Arcane Battery, allowing you to cast a spell for free. Moreover, it improves spell attack rolls.\n\n\nStaff of the Emperor\nGives bonus Spell Save DC and spell attack rolls. Moreover, its unique effect allows you to Stun enemies if you succeed in a Saving Throw against their effects.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nListing this one as an interesting option for synergies with Cutting Words. The weapon gives additional reactions, allowing you to use actions and spells a second time per turn.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield there is for a caster with bonus Spell Save DC.\n\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nThe strongest shield in the game, with plenty of bonuses.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave(BiS)\nThe hood gives solid +2 Spell Save DC, greatly improving spell success chance.\n\n\nBirthright\nPerfect helm for caster, if another one has been taken.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave(BiS)\nImprove Spell Save DC by one, the best option for a direct increase in build effectiveness.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverbation, this cloak is amazing and allows Dazing enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall(BiS)\nAs a caster that heavily relies on Concentration spells, this is probably the best armor to wear. The Constitution saving throw advantage is more than awesome.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nThe best clothing for caster. Not only improves spellcasting but also provides a +2 Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Reviving Hands(BiS)\nImproved version of Hellrider's Pride. However, it requires medium armor proficiency. If you do not have it, use the original ones.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nThe gloves are still relevant if you are relying on a Mass Healing Word​ spell.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, also gives a level 3 Command spell for each Long Rest. The gloves provide +1 Spell Save DC,\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe best boots to use with the build\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout(BiS)\nThe Best amulet for this build. However, this piece of equipment is the best caster choice, so can be contested by other party members.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nIf you want to maximize the healing amount of your spells, this amulet is one of the options.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Mental Inhibition(BiS)\nProvides an easy way to apply Mental Fatigue with spells.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nBe sure to get this ring, as it will be an extremely powerful addition once you start using the Mass Healing Word​ setup.\n\n\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThis ring gives an unlisted buff of Spell Save DC +1."

        "The early game can be hard, as you do not know where to find items. Picking the correct spells should cover most of the needs. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee\nThe Spellsparkler\nEach hit generates Lightning Charges that later detonate for bonus lightning damage. This staff should also support you in Act 2.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nGives +1 to spell attack rolls or DC. An alternative to The Spellsparkler in case it is used by someone else.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have used for bonus action if your Sorcery points have been expended, so this will allow some bonus damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nIncreases Spell Save Difficulty Counter, while obscured. Very easy to activate, use Shift, to see the sun icon, it should be half or full empty.\n\n\nThe Lifebringer\nThe best defensive option in Act 1. Works well with The Spellsparkler. Without it, the item loses its purpose.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nAnything will work as Act 1 does not have any good options.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nWorks well with The Spellsparkler for additional bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws with Lightning Charges. The best choice in Act 1.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nApplies Reverbation when dealing thunder or lightning damage. With 5 stacks, this will deal a bonus 1d4 damage and can make enemies Prone. This can be easily achieved once you have The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\nGives bonus spell attack rolls, making Scorching Ray​ and later Eldritch Blast​ succeed better.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nGives whooping +2 Armour Class. This is the perfect option especially if you do not have shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves that allow to negate enemy ranged attack.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly, unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese shoes are in high demand, but give an option to apply Reverberation​.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nA good amulet that allows restoring level 3 or lower spell slots. This way you could get additional sorcery points.\n\n\nAmulet of Elemental Torment\nThis amulet can be used to improve the damage of spells like Eldritch Blast​ and Scorching Ray​ when standing on an element surface.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nA good amulet to obtain mobility via Misty Step.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows Casting invisibility for free once per long rest.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee\nMelf's First Staff\nThese items are still relevant in Act 2 and provide very good bonuses.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nThis bow allows casting Haste without using a spell slot. However, if you do not care about that, continue using the items from Act 1.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe only shield that improves the Spell Difficulty class and attack rolls.\n\n\nShield of Devotion\nThe extra level 1 spell slot can be used for Sorcery Points.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nThe best choice in Act 2 for any caster. Gives bonus initiative and Spell Save Difficulty Counter.\n\n\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThis headwear unlocks a very effective synergy. Where you can use Scorching Ray​ to stack Arcane Acuity and get almost guaranteed spell success.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIncreases the chance of a critical hit. This only works while obscured, which can be activated by standing in dark areas. (Use Shift to see if the area is obscured)\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nUse this Cloak if you will still be using Reverbation items like Gloves of Belligerent Skies\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nOne of the main items that makes the build as powerful as it is. This requires to make some specific decisions during Act 1. However, the boost to Eldritch Blast​ damage is worth it.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nYou can continue using the same items from Act 1.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nAlthough these boots could be used in Act 1, as we did not have a decent way to apply statuses consistently, we delayed them till Act 2.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives armor class an increase. Best choice if you are not using Shield\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet\nAn awesome amulet that allows applying Reverbation with Each spell attack. This will reduce the success of some Saving Throws. I would say this is the second-best amulet for this build.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nVery interesting choice. Because the build will deal a decent amount of critical hits, this will allow it to paralyze many humanoid enemies. Give this one a try.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nWhen creatures are illuminated you deal bonus damage to them, this should not be hard, as your cleric will probably be carrying something like Blood of Lathander to illuminate them. Or you could stand closer to enemies and have a Light spell on yourself.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nIt is fairly easy to cast any light spell on yourself or have an ally do that. The Radiating Orb effect will debuff enemies, making it harder for them to hit targets.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nBecause it is easy to be obscured this allows to gain bonus armour class. Very useful in Act 2."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe most powerful stave in the game. You can imbue it with different elements - fire, for bonus fire damage, lightning - for higher lightning charge generation. So if going all in on Eldritch Blast, set Bolts of Doom.\n\n\nRhapsody(BiS)\nThe unique effect that gives +1 damage for each Scarlet Remittance stack. This requires you to kill enemies (previously you could destroy barrels), but this should be easy in late game where normal grunts will be dead from your blasts in a few hits.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nGives a bonus to Spell Attack Rolls and Spell Save DC. Also allows casting a spell without using a spell slot per long rest. You can also get Dual Wielder feat and use this together with Markoheshkir. But it is outclassed in my opinion by The Spellsparkler and Rhapsody.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nA perfect choice in case you want additional critical chances and other options are taken by other characters. Synergizes well with Mortal Reminder.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow to increase critical hit roll range. Although it may be taken by other characters in the group.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nImproved bow of Bow of Awareness, with higher initiative boost.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThis is still the top contender for the build if you will opt out for a shield instead of dual wielding weapons.\n\n\nHead\nBirthright(BiS)\nI think this is the best choice as it gives higher Charisma and allows reaching the maximum of 24. It also improves every aspect of Sorcerer Warlock - spellcasting, ability checks, attack rolls, etc.\n\n\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThis headwear unlocks a very effective synergy. Where you can use Scorching Ray​ to stack Arcane Acuity and get almost guaranteed spell success.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nProvides +2 to spell attack rolls leading to higher hit chance and overall better damage output.\n\n\nHat of the Sharp Caster\nImproves damage output by rerolling low damage rolls.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave(BiS)\nThis is the best cloak for this build as it gives a direct boost to attack rolls. The result is more successful spells.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe(BiS)\nThis continues to be the best robe for Sorlock if you will heavily rely on Eldritch Blast.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nA very good overall robe that improves spell effectiveness and success rate.\n\n\nArmour of Landfall\nGives advantages to Constitution Saving Throws, increases Spell Save DC, and an additional spell.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies(BiS)\nThe gloves are even better with all the bonuses that you can get with lightning and radiant damage.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nRidiculously powerful gloves that are bugged, and create a separate instance of damage with Eldritch Blast​ for each hit.\n\n\nSpellmight Gloves\nAmazing gloves, that work with spells that use attack rolls. If they are taken by other characters, use the ones from previous acts. However, they will lower attack rolls, so be sure to have Risky Ring to improve success chances.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nOne of the best gloves in the game. They would improve your attack rolls and Spell Save DC.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe boots become even more powerful as your critical chance increases and you can apply conditions more easily from Mortal Reminder. This also works with the Coruscation Ring.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nOptimal choice if you are wearing a robe and go all in on the dual-wielding, this way you get bonus armor class.\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet(BiS)\nYou can use this amulet to get more bonuses for Reverbation activation.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nGives whooping +2 Spell Save DC. However, this item will be a contender for any other caster builds in the group, specifically clerics.\n\n\nRings\nCoruscation Ring(BiS)\nThis ring can be used to hit multiple foes with Eldritch Blast​ and apply a radiating orb.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring(BiS)\nDeals bonus 2 damage against illuminated enemies. Although it is not much, this also works with spells. Just be sure to cast Light on yourself. I recommend using the ring together with Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThe ring gives +1 Sepll Save DC even if it is not listed.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This works well with Spellmight Gloves. Without those, I would equip the ring on someone else as it is very valuable for almost any build."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nThese weapons are go-to picks if you want other options, especially for more damage. You would need to use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to wear these effectively.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\n\n\nSword of Justice\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nAn excellent weapon that can be used with dexterity. It also comes with Phalar Aluve: Melody​ to apply buffs/debuffs depending on what you need in a combat situation.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nSimilar to Phalar Aluve, it can be used effectively with high Dexterity and comes with a unique area attack.\n\n\n+1 Weapon\nPurchase any +1 weapon in Druid's Grove like Greataxe +1, Greatsword +1, etc.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear for pure weapon damage increase.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nGives immunity to critical hits.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe best heavy armor in Act 1, with critical immunity and damage reduction.\n\n\nChain Mail +1\nEarly armor, once you get a few levels up, comes with 17 Armour Class.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Perfect option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies the Baneful Strike​ effect, which weakens foe saving throws, making them perfect targets for control actions or spells. This can make many bosses easier, as you can now land spells with a higher chance. For example, you can use this to make Control Undead​ or Command​ easier to land.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source for the main damage types.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nObtainable at the later part of Act 2, depending on your decision regarding Nightston. This will reward you with one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with +2 enchantment and comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Act weapons still play a decent role, and can be used effectively.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nIt's not better than Diadem of Arcane Synergy, but if you have Booming Blade,​ you could use Ring of Arcane Synergy instead. This means you can get some nice undead in Act 2 with a higher chance when casting Control Undead.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA sidegrade to Adamantine Splint Armour with a boost to Constitution and AC, but lower damage reduction.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nYou will want to wear these gloves if you are using the Natural Strength setup, to invest dexterity points into Constitution.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nIt can be used together with Divine Smite​ to weaken enemies.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a psychic damage rider, which is easy to activate by using one of the Concentration spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you have a hard time getting Advantage on your attacks, this is the easiest fix, although it comes with a disadvantage on mental saves.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks."

        "Here, the main setup change is that you will use Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength and switch them up with Strength Elixirs. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening(BiS)\nThese are the best weapons in terms of damage, but require you to have Bhaalist Armour for Aura Of Murder​ effect. I do prefer Nyrulna as it comes with neat weapon actions, which are usable and good.\n\n\nNyrulna\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThese are the two-hander options, without Aura Of Murder​. They are both decent weapon options, but are inferior to piercing ones, when it's easy to apply vulnerability.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn terms of pure damage, this is the best option as it enables you to activate Arcane Synergy​ to utilize your high charisma for damage.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nA flat damage boost on melee attacks.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is one of the options, in case the headwear is free. You can use it together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to disable foes using the Command​ spell. It is also useful for Control Undead.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIn terms of utility, this is one of the best headwear - critical immunity, Stunned​ immunity, and each round healing.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nOne of the best defensive cloaks, improving your chances of avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis is the best pick in terms of combat potential. It doesn't mean that you have to wear it, but at least one frontline member should have it. It will double piercing damage via Aura Of Murder, this is why Shar's Spear of Evening or Nyrulna are one of the best picks.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nBoth of these are great armours. I would probably prioritize Armour of Persistence for its Blade Ward​ effect.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nSets the Strength to 23, allowing you to stop using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and opening the elixir slot for better ones like Elixir of Bloodlust.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives a good damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nThese are the best boots to take for any kind of build to avoid any of the various surface effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives increased damage as long as you drink a potion or get a healing source.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nNot that high of a priority here, especially when not using items like Helmet of Grit. But still, one of the options if it's available.\n\n\n-\nAmulets from the previous Acts.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nPretty easy to get the bonus damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs the build has plenty of concentration spells, the psychic damage rider is easy to obtain and can be even doubled if any of the party members use Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring can only be used if you have Booming Blade. It is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy, which allows using different headwear, albeit at the cost of damage rings.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nAs mentioned, this can be used together with Helmet of Arcane Acuity\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA solid ring, that boost main armour class.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nA one-time ring that you can use to land a critical hit with Divine Smite​ and unequip it until the next long rest.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nStill an option, but I would avoid it, as getting Advantage should not be a problem by this time in the game."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nObtainable at the later part of Act 2, depending on your decision regarding Nightston. This will reward you with one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with +2 enchantment and comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Act weapons still play a decent role, and can be used effectively.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nIt's not better than Diadem of Arcane Synergy, but if you have Booming Blade,​ you could use Ring of Arcane Synergy instead. This means you can get some nice undead in Act 2 with a higher chance when casting Control Undead.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA semi-upgrade to Adamantine Splint Armour with a boost to Constitution and AC, but lower damage reduction.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nYou will want to wear these gloves if you are using the Natural Strength setup, to invest dexterity points into Constitution.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a psychic damage rider, which is easy to activate by using one of the Concentration spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you have a hard time getting Advantage on your attacks, this is the easiest fix, although it comes with a disadvantage on mental saves.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nCan be used for a single encounter, to get a guaranteed critical hit. After that, you can switch it with other rings."

        "Here, the main setup change is that you will use Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength and switch them up with Strength Elixirs. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening(BiS)\nThese are the best weapons in terms of damage, but require you to have Bhaalist Armour for Aura Of Murder​ effect. I do prefer Nyrulna as it comes with neat weapon actions, which are usable and good.\n\n\nNyrulna\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThese are the two-hander options, without Aura Of Murder​. They are both decent weapon options, but are inferior to piercing ones, when it's easy to apply vulnerability.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn terms of pure damage, this is the best option as it enables you to activate Arcane Synergy​ to utilize your high charisma for damage.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nA flat damage boost on melee attacks.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is one of the options, in case the headwear is free. You can use it together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to disable foes using the Command​ spell. It is also useful for Control Undead.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIn terms of utility, this is one of the best headwear - critical immunity, Stunned​ immunity, and each round healing.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nOne of the best defensive cloaks, improving your chances of avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis is the best pick in terms of combat potential. It doesn't mean that you have to wear it, but at least one frontline member should have it. It will double piercing damage via Aura Of Murder, this is why Shar's Spear of Evening or Nyrulna are one of the best picks.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nBoth of these are great armours. I would probably prioritize Armour of Persistence for its Blade Ward​ effect.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nSets the Strength to 23, allowing you to stop using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and opening the elixir slot for better ones like Elixir of Bloodlust.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives a good damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe simplest option for Natural Strength setup.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nThese are the best boots to take for any kind of build to avoid any of the various surface effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives increased damage as long as you drink a potion or get a healing source.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nNot that high of a priority here, especially when not using items like Helmet of Grit. But still, one of the options if it's available.\n\n\n-\nAmulets from the previous Acts.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nPretty easy to get the bonus damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs the build has plenty of concentration spells, the psychic damage rider is easy to obtain and can be even doubled if any of the party members use Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring can only be used if you have Booming Blade. It is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy, which allows using different headwear, albeit at the cost of damage rings.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThe ring allows casting spells with bonus action and can be used with Helmet of Arcane Acuity to boost your Spell success chance. Of course, you can also use it to cast Plant Growth​ to greatly empower your spellsword capabilities.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA solid ring that boosts armour class.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nA one-time ring that you can use to land a critical hit with Divine Smite​ and unequip it until the next long rest.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nStill an option, but I would avoid it, as getting Advantage should not be a problem by this time in the game."

For example, you can use this to make Control Undead​ or Command​ easier to land.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nIt can be used together with Divine Smite​ to weaken enemies.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source for the main damage types.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nIf you don't have a cleric, using this ring with Healing Radiance​ allows you to buff allies with Bless​ effect.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nObtainable at the later part of Act 2, depending on your decision regarding Nightston. This will reward you with one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with +2 enchantment and comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Act weapons still play a decent role, and can be used effectively.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nIt's not better than Diadem of Arcane Synergy, but if you have Booming Blade,​ you could use Ring of Arcane Synergy instead. This means you can get some nice undead in Act 2 with a higher chance when casting Control Undead.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA semi-upgrade to Adamantine Splint Armour with a boost to Constitution and AC, but lower damage reduction.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nYou will want to wear these gloves if you are using the Natural Strength setup, to invest dexterity points into Constitution.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nContinues to be my recommended option, as it gives a unique spin to Ancients Paladin and expands its role as support build.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a psychic damage rider, which is easy to activate by using one of the Concentration spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you have a hard time getting Advantage on your attacks, this is the easiest fix, although it comes with a disadvantage on mental saves.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks."

        "Here, the main setup change is that you will use Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength and switch them up with Strength Elixirs. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening(BiS)\nThese are the best weapons in terms of damage, but require you to have Bhaalist Armour for Aura Of Murder​ effect. I do prefer Nyrulna as it comes with neat weapon actions, which are usable and good.\n\n\nNyrulna\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThese are the two-hander options, without Aura Of Murder​. They are both decent weapon options, but are inferior to piercing ones, when it's easy to apply vulnerability.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn terms of pure damage, this is the best option as it enables you to activate Arcane Synergy​ to utilize your high charisma for damage.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nA flat damage boost on melee attacks.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is one of the options, in case the headwear is free. You can use it together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to disable foes using the Command​ spell. It is also useful for Control Undead.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIn terms of utility, this is one of the best headwear - critical immunity, Stunned​ immunity, and each round healing.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nOne of the best defensive cloaks, improving your chances of avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis is the best pick in terms of combat potential. It doesn't mean that you have to wear it, but at least one frontline member should have it. It will double piercing damage via Aura Of Murder, this is why Shar's Spear of Evening or Nyrulna are one of the best picks.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nBoth of these are great armours. I would probably prioritize Armour of Persistence for its Blade Ward​ effect.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nSets the Strength to 23, allowing you to stop using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and opening the elixir slot for better ones like Elixir of Bloodlust.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives a good damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe simplest option for Natural Strength setup.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nThese are the best boots to take for any kind of build to avoid any of the various surface effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives increased damage as long as you drink a potion or get a healing source.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nNot that high of a priority here, especially when not using items like Helmet of Grit. But still, one of the options if it's available.\n\n\n-\nAmulets from the previous Acts.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nPretty easy to get the bonus damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs the build has plenty of concentration spells, the psychic damage rider is easy to obtain and can be even doubled if any of the party members use Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring can only be used if you have Booming Blade. It is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy, which allows using different headwear, albeit at the cost of damage rings.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThe ring allows casting spells with bonus action and can be used with Helmet of Arcane Acuity to boost your Spell success chance. Of course, you can also use it to cast Plant Growth​ to greatly empower your spellsword capabilities.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring continues to be an option, but I think there are better items to use in this slot, especially as the build starts to become very powerful without Bless​ buff.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA solid ring that boosts armour class.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nA one-time ring that you can use to land a critical hit with Divine Smite​ and unequip it until the next long rest.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nStill an option, but I would avoid it, as getting Advantage should not be a problem by this time in the game."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMourning Frost\nThe best staff, for Ice-based caster build. You will get it quite late in Act 1, but it deals bonus damage and applies chilled on enemies, which can either freeze them or double cold damage.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nVery good item, as it is the first weapon to give bonus Spell Save DC. Can be obtained before Mourning Frost.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nAlthough this staff does not give increased Spell Save DC, the bonus lightning charges interact well with other gear and also increase spell damage.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is an amazing weapon as you can use a bonus action to break Water to apply Wet.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nVery good shield similar to Safeguard Shield, just gives a bonus Heroism​ cantrip. Only use it if you have Absolute's Brand.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nIt gives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThis headwear gives bonus Spell Save DC, increasing the success chance of many spells.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nAmazing armor, as it gives +1 AC when you have lightning charges and also increases spell success chance.\n\n\nInfernal Robe\nA great robe early in the game, however, requires a specific decision, that is not very liked by many players.\n\n\nGloves\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves will allow your frost spells to apply Encrusted with Frost. This gives a disadvantage on Dexterity saves, and any ice surface will make it easier for them to fall due to the Dexterity Saving Throw.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\nAmazing gloves that work well with this build once you are in close range. This negates the penalty of nearby enemies, with some spells.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves to reduce the damage of incoming ranged attacks.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nDecent early-game gloves that give good armor class, in case you do not have Shield proficiency.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nI would say these are the best boots in terms of \"offensive\" boost. However, as you will be casting various Ice spells, this can become problematic when moving on it.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nVery good boots, especially once you start using Cold spells later in the game. This will allow you to walk on the surface easily.\n\n\nAmulet\nNecklace of Elemental Augmentation\nThis is the best amulet that you can use for this build throughout the game. However, you should only use it if you plan on going the Ray of Frost​ route.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestore up to level 3 spell slot. Can be unequipped after use.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nAmazing ring, that allows moving longer distances.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Sparkswall\nReduces lightning damage received."
      ],
      "2": [
        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\nMourning Frost\nContinues to be your best weapon option for this Act also.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste before combat. This may not seem as big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is insufficient. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nIt gives bonus Spell Save DC, which is amazing for better success when casting spells.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nImproves spell success chance and increases the likelihood of going first.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nI would say this is a contender for the best helmet in Act 2. However, it all depends on your playstyle. If you use Ray of Frost​ or Sleet Storm​ heavily, then this item is a no-brainer. Otherwise, go for the option above.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nThe best robe to enhance Ray of Frost​ damage. If you plan on using this cantrip till the end of the game the robe will be best in slot.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nStill the best option even in Act 2. This requires Lightning Charges​, to unlock full potential.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nAnother robe that gives +1 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves will allow your frost spells to apply Encrusted with Frost. This gives a disadvantage on Dexterity saves and any ice surface will make it easier for them to fall due to Dexterity Saving Throw.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nIn case you want a little more armour class and you can manage ice surfaces use this.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best option, especially when walking on icy surfaces so that you would not get prone when initiating an opportunity of attack.\n\n\nAmulet\nNecklace of Elemental Augmentation\nThe necklace still takes the top slot for being the best choice to optimize Ray of Frost​ damage.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt can be used to restore spell slots and unequip after that.\n\n\nRings\nSnowburst Ring\nRelevant ring for Cold builds as this will create ice surfaces, greatly improving the chances of enemies getting prone and skipping their turn.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe additional radiant damage is a great way to boost damage. However, this item is a contender for many builds, and it will somewhat fall off in Act 3 compared to the total damage output you will do.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nA very powerful ring that I had some reservations recommending. It will work well to increase your spell hit chance, however, this item is in demand by almost all builds.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nAmazing ring that can debuff your foes. However, this only works with spells that require Saving Throw - Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, etc.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armor class for survivability."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. There are two main setups that I see, that I would like to cover with weapons: Now, for the other equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best caster staff in the game (well, almost the best). This fits the build extremely well and you can use Kereska's Favour. Pick Frost of Dark Winter to get a bonus cold damage boost and unlock an additional Cone of Cold​ and Ice Storm.\n\n\nRhapsody\nThis item is extremely powerful for almost any build that can dual-wield. Particularly for Ice Sorcerer, you can get bonus Spell Save DC, attack rolls, and bonus damage with Ray of Frost.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nIn case for some reason you do not have access to one of the weapons below, this staff will still serve its purpose.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nThe hood gives solid +2 Spell Save DC, greatly improving spell success chance.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nIf you are enjoying the Encrusted with Frost effect, I would recommend continue using this helmet. Moreover, if Hood of the Weave is taken it is a solid alternative.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImprove Spell Save DC by one, the best option for a direct increase in spell effectiveness.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe(BiS)\nAgain, if you plan on going with Ray of Frost​ this still holds the best spot the build.\n\n\nArmour of Landfall\nAs a caster that heavily relies on the Concentration spell, this is a good armor to wear. I would only recommend it if you did not get Potent Robe. Sadly, this will deactivate Draconic Resilience.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nThis armor is what would be \"the best\" option if you only relied on control and damage spellcasting. However, as the build heavily relies on Ray of Frost, I recommend Potent Robe.\n\n\nGloves\nGemini Gloves\nThis allows releasing an additional ray with Ray of Frost, which is the biggest damage increase you can get. However, this can only be used once per Short Rest.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves will allow your frost spells to apply Encrusted with Frost. This gives a disadvantage on Dexterity saves and any ice surface will make it easier for them to fall due to Dexterity Saving Throw.\n\n\nSpellmight Gloves\nThese are amazing gloves, particularly in the late game. They only work on spells with attack rolls, and give bonus 1d8 damage. Sadly you get -5 to your attack rolls. This can be counteracted with Bless, attacking from high ground, or improving spell attack rolls via items.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, also gives a level 3 Command spell for each Long Rest. The gloves provide +1 Spell Save DC,\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGood gloves bonus +1 Spell Save DC, but will likely be a contender for all your other builds.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nAgain, these are the best shoes in terms of damage, but they lose the utility of free movement on ice surfaces.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThese boots are amazing because you can freely walk on Ice with them, without getting prone.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nThese boots give bonus Armour class if needed.\n\n\nAmulet\nNecklace of Elemental Augmentation\nThis necklace still holds the top spot if you are going with the setup we talked about on this build.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe +2 Spell Save DC is a huge boost, giving a large success improvement for spells, it does not help with spell attack rolls. Moreover, it is one of the best items for cleric if you have it in the group so it might not be easy to use it.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThis is the only ring that gives bonus Spell Save DC, but it's not listed in the description. This may be a bug that might be patched in the future.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you can, use this ring, as it will greatly boost Ice Sorcerer's hit chance while wearing Spellmight Gloves.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nStill an excellent choice to run on this build. The ice patches will greatly inhibit multiple enemies throughout act 3, albeit many of the will be resistant to the effect."

        "Before reaching level 3, use any Finesse weapon that you have proficiency with. After that, you can switch to two-handed weapons and use Bind Pact Weapon. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the best greatswords that you can get in Act 1. The bonus to attack rolls is great for counteracting Great Weapon Master: All In​ effect.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA solid greatsword, that gives bonus armour class with Shield of Faith​ action.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is the best helmet in terms of damage improvements. It requires you to inflict a condition.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nI think the melee aspect of the build greatly benefits from this helmet, so I recommend it.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nInfernal Robe\nThe best robe is purely for Bladelock. It gives Fire Shield: Warm​ that is perfect for a frontliner. However, acquiring it, requires a very unpopular decision.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThe strongest medium armor for Act 1. Take it you have medium armor proficiency.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nI would only wear this robe if you do not have other casters in the group. They would benefit much more from it.\n\n\nBreastplate +1\nAlternative to Githyanki Half Plate if it is used by Lae'zel.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe item is a solid one for early Act 1. You can remove it from Lae'zel. This requires medium armor proficiency.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese gloves can be useful after you obtain Unseen Menace. This way you can optimize your AC a bit. Moreover, you could do a respec to minimize dexterity to 8 and put those points into CON and WIS. However, these gloves will be used for a short time, so I don't think it is mandatory.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nVery strong gloves as they give Advantage. It is the best way to counteract the Great Weapon Master: All In​ -5 attack roll effect.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nThese are the best early-game gloves, giving you a +2 Armour class if you are not using a shield.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves to reduce the damage of incoming ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nGood boots that allow moving without slowing down on difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nThis is a good amulet that can double your damage with a cost of bonus action. For example, it would work perfectly against bosses where Great Weapon Master: Bonus Attack​ may not activate every time.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet in the game that gives direct damage increase, can be activated with a single health potion before combat.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nBe sure to pick this up. You will use it later.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs you have some concentration spells, this ring can be easily activated for a little bonus damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nA solid ring with a +2 acid damage bonus on your weapon attacks.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nA good movement boost makes it easier to reach those targets."

        "For Act 2, you will be dropping that heavy armor for some great medium ones. Some of the items will still be the best ones even if they are from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game - comes with +3 enchantment, blindness immunity, and additional actions that help inflict some serious damage.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nA good alternative to Shar's Spear of Evening. It's not as powerful, without an additional damage rider, but has useful actions - that buff allies and hit multiple enemies.\n\n\nCharge-Bound Warhammer\nA really strong weapon, that is good for most of Act 2. It would be one of the best weapons in the game, if not for just +1 Enchantment.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nIt is an amazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem as big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is insufficient. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nProbably the best option for Act 2 once you obtain Ring of Arcane Synergy as melee hits will empower your spell success chance.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is great headwear that you can use to enable bonus damage. However, this requires you to inflict a condition on the enemy. This is an alternative to Ring of Arcane Synergy before obtaining it. So use only one.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Helmet\nAlternative helmet option, especially if you have something like a Paladin in the group which may use Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nThis is the best robe, for Bladelock build. It will improve Eldritch Blast​ damage and make it easy to sustain good damage between this and melee attacks.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nBest Medium armour in Act 2, if you have proficiency.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nGives a bonus of 1d4 damage, which is a good boost to melee damage.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves can be used until you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still the best ones you can equip.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nI would say this is the best Ring, that you can get, to eliminate the effect of Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nYou can start using this ring once you obtain Potent Robe. Use Eldritch Blast​ to enable Arcane Synergy, for bonus damage with your melee hits. Be sure not to use this with Diadem of Arcane Synergy as the effects overlap.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill a good ring to use, for easy +2 damage.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIf you are using Concentration spells, this would give 0.5 more damage than Caustic Band."

      "3": [
        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Overall, there are multiple setups for this build, so I would like to go through them. Choose the one that you like: Eldritch Blast Combo setup This is an improved version of the Act 2 setup and uses Eldritch Blast​ in its rotation. It is inferior in terms of damage to the below Bhaalist Armour setup. However, this one is perfect if you are doing a good playthrough. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nIf you went with the Githyanki race, this weapon is one of the best choices. It gives a specific race bonus and additional psychic damage.\n\n\nNyrulna\nAn amazing weapon with two unique actions that Bladelock can utilize for a wider variety of attacks.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best contenders for the Bladelock build. It plays well with Devil's Sight​ and gives another source of Darkness.\n\n\nHellfire Greataxe\nI wanted to recommend something unique, and this weapon is amazing. One downside is that many of the stronger enemies will be resistant to its bonus fire damage.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nImproves critical range for attack rolls.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nI would pick this bow if you are using Heavy Armour. The bonus initiative would be a huge boost to do some damage early in the turn.\n\n\nHead\nBirthright\nThe best helmet if you plan on going with this setup where you use Eldritch Blast​ in rotations.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nThis helmet synergizes well with Broodmother's Revenge to activate the 1d6 poison bonus.\n\n\nSarevok's Horned Helmet\nIncreases critical range for attack rolls. Why it's not the best? Well, the Helm of Balduran + Broodmother's Revenge is a better combo, if you are too lazy to heal before each encounter. Otherwise, equip this.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nThe bonus armor class is great for better survivability.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nGives a solid boost to Eldritch Blast​ damage. This will be the core cantrip in activating Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe best medium armor in the game. It also does not limit your Armour class bonus from dexterity. Of course, using this compared to the options above will be a damage hit, but you may not use them for any particular reason, so suggesting this here.\n\n\nRobe of Supreme Defences\nA great robe that gives improved Saving Throws based on the spellcasting modifier. It is perfect if you like using a lot of concentration spells like Hunger of Hadar, Eyebite, etc.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nVery good gloves, but might be contested by other builds. Overall these would be a bit more powerful than Spellmight Gloves, as you could hit 4 times when hasted and inflict Bleed.\n\n\nSpellmight Gloves\nThese are great if you are using Eldritch Blast​ at least once per turn, the bonus damage stacks up well.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives bonuses to attack and damage rolls. However, this requires medium armor proficiency, so that is why they are lower in the rankings.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\nI did not use them in the build, but these could be excellent for casting Eldritch Blast​ in melee range.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nAn alternative boot to Disintegrating Night Walkers. It's not better by any means just an alternative.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nI would say this is an upgraded version of Evasive Shoes, just remember that the item does not work with armor.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet that gives a direct damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIt could be used to improve the survivability of the build. If using it remember to set your constitution to 8 using respec.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nThe best Ring, that you can get, to eliminate the effect of Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nYou can use this together with Eldritch Blast, to empower your next melee attacks. Due to high Charisma, this will be 6-7 bonus damage per hit. Bhaalist Setup This is the equipment that I recommend if you are going for no compromise high damage. I find it a bit tedious, but you cannot argue with huge damage numbers this does. This setup does forgo spellcasting, maybe an occasional Hunger of Hadar, but otherwise, you will do extremely high damage with normal hits. Two-Handed Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nPlays well with Darkness​ as this weapon can activate it. It also gains bonus damage against the enemies in the shadows which doubles with Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nNyrulna\nThe piercing weapon is amazing as its damage will be doubled. Together with its unique actions, it makes it one of the best weapons for this setup.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nTechnically not a two-handed weapon, but you will keep your offhand free. This is one of the best rapiers in the game, giving a way to attack with a bonus action. It is weaker than the above weapons because Great Weapon Master: All In​ bonus damage will not work (so you can drop it). However, the rapier is beautiful and offers a unique playstyle. Dual-Wielding Remember to remove the Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Main-Hand)\nCrimson Mischief\nTogether with Bhaalist Armour, this is one of the strongest combos, that will deal huge amounts of damage. After that pick the correct offhand weapon option.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nHarmonic Dueller\nThe strongest setup for dual-wielding offhand, as it can get bonus damage from the charisma modifier. This does require some juggling with feats:\n\nAbility Improvement +2 Charisma\nDual Wielder​\nActor​ - this ensures that you can easily activate the weapon's special ability, Mellow Harmony.\n\n\n\n\nBelm\nAn excellent weapon that has a special action to replicate the main weapon attack when it is worn in an offhand. This uses bonus action.\n\n\nRhapsody\nAmazing off-hand weapon that can give you bonus damage, attack rolls, and spell save DC. All in one!\n\n\nInfernal Rapier\nIf got your hands on this weapon it is an amazing one. However, it requires a Dual Wielder​ feat. You also get the spell Planar Ally: Cambion. Remaining equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nExcellent bow for higher initiative, allowing to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nImproves critical range for attack rolls.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nRequires you to inflict a condition for it to be activated. With Bhaalist Armour this is very easy to do. This gives bonus damage to weapon attacks from the spellcasting modifier.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nThis helmet synergizes well with Broodmother's Revenge to activate the 1d6 poison bonus.\n\n\nSarevok's Horned Helmet\nThe last option for Act 3 headwear. The crit range does give some bonus damage but it is very low.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nBest armor as it doubles damage with Piercing weapons. This includes weapons like Nyrulna or Shar's Spear of Evening. You should use this one for the most powerful setup.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nVery good gloves, but might be contested by other builds. Overall these would be a bit more powerful than Spellmight Gloves, as you could hit 4 times when hasted and inflict Bleed.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives bonuses to attack and damage rolls. However, this requires medium armor proficiency, so that is why they are lower in the rankings.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nAn alternative boot to Disintegrating Night Walkers. It's not better by any means just an alternative.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet that gives a direct damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIt could be used to improve the survivability of the build. If using it remember to set your constitution to 8 using respec.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nThe best Ring, that you can get, to eliminate the effect of Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nGives a bonus of 2 acid damage on weapon attacks.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nExtra radiant damage rider. I do want to mention one combo, that you might be interested in trying: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nSo with this combo, you can pump up Spell Save DC and get very high spell success chances. However, this combo is somewhat limited on Bladelock as it doesn't have multi-hit weapon attacks.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel"

        "The core items of the build are obtained in Act 1, so be sure not to miss those items as they will play a crucial role in making the Lightbearer effective. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nBlood of Lathander\nI think this weapon deserves an honorable mention. It looks cool and has satisfying and useful effects.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nContinue using weapons from Act 1, as nothing comes close in terms of usefulness.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nStill the best bow, as initiative plays a vital role for a Cleric.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nCan be useful to precast Haste​ in some encounters.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nHat of Fire Acuity\nThis headwear can be useful with Scorching Ray​ as it will allow easily stacking Spell Save DC and reach almost 100% spell success. Otherwise, if you are not interested in this mechanic I would continue using Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStil the best gloves for the Light Cleric.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying various conditions.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nThis will help with building Radiating Orb stacks. However, with all the effects you will be applying, this might be overkill as you will already be proccing Luminous Armour.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds another Dazed effect that can be procced after 5 Reverbation stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nUse the same weapons from the previous acts, as nothing comes close to them.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nOne of the best headwear for spellcasters, giving +2 Spell Save DC. This can be contested by other casters as it is in high demand.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImproves Spell Save DC. However, the main caveat is that this cloak is in demand by all casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nStill the best armor in the game.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nReuse the same gloves from previous acts.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nOverall, the best amulet for Cleric builds. Gives additional Channel Divinity Charge and improved Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRings\n-\nReuse the same rings from previous Acts."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nBoots\nThe Watersparkers\nThese boots are an interesting choice, especially together with The Sparkswall. If you cast Create Water​ and stand on it this will apply shock damage to everyone. In addition, Thunderbolt Strike​ will push enemies around wasting their movement speed.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians. So use these boots together with the mentioned spell.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nThe Sparkswall\nMakes you resistant to lightning damage and you are immune to electrocution. You can then stand on electrified water surfaces, which works perfectly with The Watersparkers.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nThis helmet can be useful to improve your Spell Save DC a little. Still, your thunder spells like Shatter​ even if hit by multiple enemies will only give 1 stack.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStil the best gloves for the Tempest Cleric as they will synergize with your Lightning, Thunder, and Radiant spells.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nThe Watersparkers\nThese boots are an interesting choice, especially together with The Sparkswall. If you cast Create Water​ and stand on it this will apply shock damage to everyone. In addition, Thunderbolt Strike​ will push enemies around wasting their movement speed.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nA better choice if you will not be using the Electrified Water mechanic and rely more on Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nThe Sparkswall\nMakes you resistant to lightning damage and you are immune to electrocution. You can then stand on electrified water surfaces, which works perfectly with The Watersparkers.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nThis will help with building Radiating Orb stacks. However, with all the effects you will be applying, this might be overkill as you will already be proccing Luminous Armour.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells."

However, the main caveat is that this cloak is in demand by all casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nStill the best armor in the game.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nReuse the same gloves from previous acts.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nOverall, the best amulet for Cleric builds.

If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\n \nHand Crossbow +2\nThis is an improved version that you can dual wield with another hand crossbow, for an offensive option using bonus action.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nOne of the best headwear for spellcasters, giving +2 Spell Save DC. This can be contested by other casters as it is in high demand.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImproves Spell Save DC. However, the main caveat is that this cloak is in demand by all casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nStill the best armor in the game.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nReuse the same gloves from previous acts.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nOverall, the best amulet for Cleric builds. Gives additional Channel Divinity Charge and improved Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nReuse the same rings from previous Acts.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nVery good item, as it is the first weapon to give bonus Spell Save DC.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nAlthough this staff does not give increased Spell Save DC, the bonus lightning charges interact well with other gear and also increase spell damage.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack twice in the early game with main action and bonus action. It can also be used to break Water with a bonus action shot, in case you need to apply Wet​ condition on enemies.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nVery good shield similar to Safeguard Shield, just gives a bonus Heroism​ cantrip. Only use it if you have Absolute's Brand.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe best headwear in Act 1. Just be sure to be obscured if you can.\n\n\nCap of Curing\nThe restored health is a good bonus when you use up Bardic Inspiration.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nAmazing armor, as it gives +1 AC when you have lightning charges and also increases spell success chance.\n\n\nInfernal Robe\nA solid robe that gives +1 Armour class. However, it requires a very unpopular decision for many players.\n\n\nBlazer of Benevolence\nBard item, that gives bonus HP after Bardic Inspiration​ use. However, it is light armor, so if you use Mage Armour​ the spell will not work.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nFor now, be sure to get these gloves, as they will come in useful in the next act, together with some gear.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGloves specific for Bard, allowing to gain one more Bardic Inspiration​ charge.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nThese are the best early-game gloves, giving you a +2 Armour class if you are not using a shield.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves to reduce the damage of incoming ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese will be the best boots you use throughout the game. Each time you apply a condition, Reverberation​ stacks will apply, for further increased success of melee actions and some spells. 5 stacks will deal thunder damage.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nVery good boots, especially once you start using Cold spells later in the game. This will allow you to walk on the surface easily.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nThis is a good amulet before you get some use for a bonus action. Use it to apply vulnerabilities that you or others can exploit with their weapons.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestore up to a level 3 spell slot. Can be unequipped after use.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nSilver Pendant\nA somewhat useful amulet to get the Guidance​ buff for various dice checks.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nExcellent ring, which can apply Bless​ when you heal with the Healing Word.\n\n\nRing of Mind-Shielding\nAs there are no better options for this type of build in Act 1."
      ],
      "2": [
        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThese staves from Act 1 are still a solid choice.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows for precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nGives bonus Spell Save DC, which is amazing for better success when casting spells.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nGives a solid initiative boost to improve your combat turn order.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nImproves spell success chance and increases the likelihood of going first.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nThe best robe that you can use with Eldritch Blast. It will greatly improve damage, allowing it to effectively take care of foes.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nStill the best option even in Act 2.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nAnother robe that gives +1 Spell Save DC, get this if you can't use The Protecty Sparkswall.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for the build. You will need a way to get some thunder and radiant damage. For this Callous Glow Ring and Spineshudder Amulet with Reverberation​ stacking will help.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots are the best option due to the Reverbation stacking.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt can be used to restore spell slots and unequip after that.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nI would say it is one of the best rings as it will give additional reverbation stacks when you are wearing Gloves of Belligerent Skies. Moreover, this will give an additional 2 damage.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nAny of your control spells that enemies will fail now also incur Mental Fatigue.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nExcellent ring, that applies Radiating Orb​, and can trigger the Boots of Stormy Clamour effect.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThis is a very good ring if you are using a lot of Eldritch Blast, which will improve your hit chance. However, the item is in high demand for many builds, so I would prioritise it on other martials instead."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. There are two main setups that I see, that I would like to cover with weapons: Now, for the other equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best caster staff in the game. I would only suggest using it if there is no other caster in the group. Otherwise, I would skip this. If you will use it, I recommend activating Bolts of Doom​ from Kereska's Favour​, as this will generate Lightning Charges, that will boost Eldritch Blast​ damage. You will also get solid offensive spells - Chain Lightning​ and Lightning Bolt.\n\n\nRhapsody\nThis is the second best weapon to have in your arsenal once you have Dual Wielder. It will boost both spell attack rolls and Spell Save DC. Of course, you will need to rake some kills to activate its effect.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nIt has an Arcane Battery, allowing you to cast a spell for free. Moreover, it improves spell attack rolls.\n\n\nStaff of the Emperor\nGives bonus Spell Save DC and spell attack rolls. Moreover, its unique effect allows you to Stun enemies if you succeed in a Saving Throw against their effects.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nListing this one as an interesting option for synergies with Cutting Words. The weapon gives additional reactions, allowing you to use actions and spells a second time per turn.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nHead\nBirthright\nI would say this is the best option for headwear as you will get +2 damage per ray with Eldritch Blast.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nThe hood gives solid +2 Spell Save DC, greatly improving spell success chance.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImprove Spell Save DC by one, the best option for a direct increase in spell effectiveness.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nThe best defensive cloak\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverberation​, this cloak is amazing and allows Dazed​ enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe(BiS)\nThe best robe that you can use with Eldritch Blast. It will greatly improve its reaching that of a solid offensive spell.\n\n\nArmour of Landfall\nAs a caster that heavily relies on Concentration spells, this is probably the best armor to wear. The Constitution saving throw advantage is more than awesome.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nOne of the best clothing for caster. Not only improves spellcasting but also provides a +2 Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThese gloves are still the top option in my opinion, as they make it easy to stack additional reverbation stacks.\n\n\nSpellmight Gloves\nThese will improve Eldritch Blast​ damage at the cost of lower attack rolls. I still think that debuffs are a bit better especially as the build might not use Risky Ring.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, also gives a level 3 Command spell for each Long Rest. The gloves provide +1 Spell Save DC,\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nVery good gloves, but might be contested by other builds, specifically, martial ones.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe best boots to use with the build\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe +2 Spell Save DC is a huge boost, giving a large success improvement for spells.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring(BiS)\nI would say it is one of the best rings as it will give additional reverbation stacks when you are wearing Gloves of Belligerent Skies. Moreover, this will give an additional 2 damage.\n\n\nRing of Feywild Sparks(BiS)\nThis is the only ring that gives bonus Spell Save DC. This may be a bug that might be patched in the future.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nProvides an easy way to apply Mental Fatigue with spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThis is a very good ring if you are using a lot of Eldritch Blast, which will improve your hit chance. However, the item is in high demand for many builds, so I would prioritise it on other martials instead."

        "Act 3, is where the Loredin Build can split into a few variations depending on what gear is available and the playstyle you want to go for. Spirit Guardians setup The main idea of this setup is to use Spirit Guardians​ which deal radiant damage and will debuff enemies thanks to the equipment you have. The whole setup can even act as a Cleric in the late game, as the core playstyle revolves around the Spirit Guardians. Another aspect is what weapons you choose. If you are willing to make a few evil decisions in Act 3 you can get Bhaalist Armour. Equip an ally with it to make them activate Aura Of Murder​ in the melee range and use one of the mentioned spears below. Otherwise, take the Two-Handed Swords as they will serve you well, with a little bit less damage. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThe best spear if you have an ally that has equipped Bhaalist Armour. Otherwise, go for the Greatsword options.\n\n\nNyrulna\nAn excellent weapon that comes with plenty of weapon actions, a thunder damage rider, and +3 enchantment. However, it does have a base roll of 1d8 which is inferior when not having piercing vulnerability. If you have an ally with Bhaalist Armour this is the perfect pick.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nAn excellent weapon that comes with plenty of weapon actions, and +3 enchantment. However, it does have a base roll of 1d8 which is inferior when not having piercing vulnerability. If you have an ally with Bhaalist Armour this is the perfect pick.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThis weapon is an excellent choice as it has good bonuses and also adds bonus damage based on the strength modifier.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nIt is an excellent sword, especially if you are Githyanki or can use Disguise Self​ from any source.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nIn terms of damage bonuses, this weapon is an excellent stat stick to improve critical rolls.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThis bow gives +3 Initiative. I think it is extremely valuable for this Radiant setup as you can go first and debuff enemies using Spirit Guardians​ before they take a turn.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nWith various gear bonuses and debuffs you can easily avoid most of the enemy attacks, this will reflect Radiant damage which will also proc Boots of Stormy Clamour for the Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nImproves weapon damage based on the charisma modifier once you apply an effect. T\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nPowerful cloak especially when you need to avoid enemy hits to maintain spell concentration.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nIncreases Armour Class and improves Saving Throws.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe key item of this setup. Each time you deal Radiant damage you will apply Radianting Orb stacks, weakening enemy attack rolls and making them miss.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThese gloves set your Strength to 23, giving a solid 6 ability modifier and you can effectively use strength weapons.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nConsidered the best weapon martial gloves, but these would require you to use Strength Elixirs to compensate for low strength.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nIf you want to go all-in on the debuff role and apply even more stacks this is a strong option. However, without the Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength, you will have to use Strength Elixirs or utilize Dexterity-based weapons.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best option for boots, especially as they will work extremely well with Spirit Guardians​ and Cutting Words​ to apply debuffs.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nYou will be a target of enemies when using Spirit Guardians, with a high Constitution and advantage on Constitution Saving Throws you can easily maintain spells.\n\n\nRings\nKiller's Sweetheart\nThe ring is very potent on Paladin as a critical hit with Divine Smite​ can be deadly against most of the enemies.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nA very simple yet risky way to obtain Advantage on hits. This will make it easier to hit enemies without much preparation and your Aura of Protection​ can set off the negative aspect.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nProvides additional radiant damage. This can be used together with Luminous Armour for radiant orb activation when you are doing normal attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\n+1 Armour Class and Saving Throws, excellent ring for improved protection. Bhaalist Setup You can go for this setup if you are more interested in Spellswords playstyle that utilizes control spells, and uses Divine Smite​ and Cutting Words​. It is a powerful option in terms of damage but does offer a more Bardadin-like playstyle. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the most powerful weapons that should be used together with Bhaalist Armour for piercing vulnerability from Aura Of Murder. Has a 1d6 damage rider that gets doubled.\n\n\nNyrulna\nA solid choice if used together with Bhaalist Armour for piercing vulnerability from Aura Of Murder. Gives bonus weapon actions and thunder damage rider.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nIt is a cool-looking rapier that also comes with additional Reaction per turn. Now you can use second Cutting Words​ per turn. This weapon does not need Great Weapon Master: All In, so respec and remove it. It will also get its damage doubled with Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nIn terms of damage bonuses, this weapon is an excellent stat stick to improve critical rolls.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThis bow gives +3 Initiative. Excellent for going first, to reach enemies and activate the Aura Of Murder​ from Bhaalist Armour so that allies with piercing weapons could exploit it.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nPick this helmet for the ability to empower your spells with stacks of Arcane Acuity. These will improve spell success chances and you can have 90%+ with spells like Hold Person.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAs the setup wears Bhaalist Armour, Aura Of Murder​ effect will easily activate the Arcane Synergy for bonus damage.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nPowerful cloak especially when you need to avoid enemy hits to maintain spell concentration.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nIncreases Armour Class and improves Saving Throws.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nOne of the most powerful armors in the game, giving an Aura Of Murder​ effect which doubles piercing damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThese gloves set your Strength to 23, giving a solid 6 ability modifier and you can effectively use strength weapons.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives improved movement when you cast a spell with Concentration.

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nThis is a sleeping beauty of the build. It can be used together with Spike Growth​ to inflict lightning damage in addition to piercing one.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStil the best gloves for the Nature Cleric.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying various conditions.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nThis will help with building Radiating Orb stacks. However, with all the effects you will be applying, this might be overkill as you will already be proccing Luminous Armour.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds another Dazed effect that can be procced after 5 Reverbation stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

Generally, it would be taken by a Sorcerer or Wizard, but in case you are not using them, definitely try using this one with its unique effects.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat.

        "This part of the game is where Arcane Archer shines the most. For this reason, getting good gear and boosting your hit chance will do wonders for your combat performance. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nUse this together with Titanstring Bow if you skip on Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. This will be a good +4 damage boost on all shots.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nThis will probably be a far-fetched fantasy, but if you don't have a caster, this can be used to improve the success chance of landing your Arrow effects.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA very popular stat stick weapon. I would say this has the lowest priority. It can be dual-wielded with Club of Hill Giant Strength if you decide to skip shields.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nIn terms of pure damage, this bow is the top option for the whole game. Use either Club of Hill Giant Strength or Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to maximize your damage.\n\n\nHarold\nSpecial crossbow that can debuff enemies and make it easier to land Arcane Shot effects.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nThis bow can be deadly with Gloves of Baneful Striking for frightening enemies and increasing your damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a reeling effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from the priestess in the Goblin camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIf you can spare this item, it can be a big damage boost based on the Intelligence modifier.\n\n\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nOpens up opportunities for easy ways to improve Spell Save DC and the success of Arcane Shots.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, which is great for better positioning to land your shots.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nIt can be a useful helmet for its bonuses and access to Hunter's Mark​ for Act 1.\n\n\nWarped Headband of Intellect\nSemi-useful headwear that could be used till level 8. Wearing it allows you to respec, set Intelligence to 8, and put points elsewhere. However, later on, once you get a third feat, you will want to maximize your intelligence in natural ways.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nTo be fair, I would be indifferent to which armor you pick. But the heavy one does give higher bonuses, and you have proficiencies to wear them.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe best starter medium armor. You can just take it from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nI recommend at least getting these gloves. They apply Bane​ on targets that you hit, making it easier to land Arcane shots. For Act 1, they are not as mandatory to wear.\n\n\nGloves of Archery\nYour ranged attacks deal an additional 2 damage, one of the best options for early game gloves.\n\n\nGloves of Power\nApplies Bane​ effect, which does come with a caveat, enemies need ot fail a saving throw, and the effect is not guaranteed. This will help with landing any further Arcane Shots.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese boots are in high demand, but if you can equip them, they provide Reverbation via your Arcane Shots applied conditions, further weakening foes.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game, giving easy traversal options and avoiding any difficult terrains and their effects.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nSimple yet effective boots, allowing you to avoid attacks of opportunity.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best amulets in the game. You can just drink a Potion of Healing and get its benefit.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nUsing a bonus action, you can weaken a foe and deal double damage with your weapon.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed for better positioning."

This is a great way to apply control over key enemies.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThe boost to Spell Save DC does wonders to this build, If you are using this helmet, you can unequip Gloves of Baneful Striking as the Arcane Acuity effect will help with it.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nAn alternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity, but you will need to use Drakethroat Glaive with Draconic Elemental Weapon: Thunder​ effect to apply thunder damage rider. This way, you can easily stack Arcane Acuity​ and improve Spell Save DC with your arrows.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAlternative headwear, before Helmet of Arcane Acuity, or if it is taken.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives an additional attack roll bonus, and works perfectly with ranged weapons if you decide to use them.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA solid armor, with high Armour Class, and other relevant bonuses.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in Act 2. With high dexterity, it can have the highest Armour Class of all gear options in this stage of the game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nGloves of Baneful Striking would be a priority as they would give an option to apply Bane​ on targets, and especially useful if you do not wear Helmet of Arcane Acuity. The other ones are an option if you will have the helmet equipped, and there are no issues with Spell Save DC.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best overall shoes with easy Reverbation option.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nAs you can get Concentration effect via Guidance, this can be helpful if you precast it. Otherwise, I would use other boots.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet, if you were able to obtain it.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nGives an easy way to deal additional radiant damage with each shot.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThis ring is a good option, but I found myself having a high hit chance without it. If need arises, you can disable Sharpshooter: All In​ to apply debuffs via Arrow of Many Targets or Gloves of Baneful Striking.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nYou can use Drakethroat Glaive to apply Cold damage to your weapon and create Ice fields with your attacks.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nApplies Mental Fatigue debuff, weakening enemies and increasing further debuffs or spell success chance.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAn easy source of additional psychic damage. You can get concentration from Guidance, casting it before combat. It also works well with Resonance Stone for double damage.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nThe ring can be useful if your party utilizes the Darkness​ spell and related mechanics.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGrants additional damage to obscured enemies."

Remember, once you get Dual Wielder,​ you can wear two of the weapons and gain +1 Armour Class. It is also safe to wear any of the caster weapons with a bonus Spell Save DC, like Staff of Spell Power, etc.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\n\n\nDolor Amarus\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters, as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role, giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nContinues to be the best bow. For Act 3, you can chug Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength for even more bonus damage or continue using Club of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nGontr Mael\nAn alternative Bow, that looks very cool and does decent damage. It also applies bonus Radiant damage.\n\n\nVicious Shortbow\nThis can be an extremely deadly bow if you have a way in the party to guarantee critical hits. This can be done with paralyzing effects like Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nThe lower priority bow, in case you do not have access to the ones above.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nI would say this is the best headwear for the Arcane Archer if you can afford to use it, and have no other Gish build. The increased Spell Save DC will make it easy to land arrow effects and disable your foes.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nAn alternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity, but you will need to use Drakethroat Glaive with Draconic Elemental Weapon: Thunder​ effect to apply thunder damage rider. This way, you can easily stack Arcane Acuity​ and improve Spell Save DC with your arrows.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nSecond-best headwear, as you get additional damage based on the Intelligence modifier. If you are not using Helmet of Arcane Acuity, I would urge you to equip Gloves of Baneful Striking to maintain the high chance of Arcane arrow success.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nThis armor would be the highlight of the build, as it doubles piercing damage with Aura Of Murder. This does require you to stand close to foes, but the huge damage boost is just too good to pass up. Moreover, another melee character can wear it and leave you to stay in a ranged distance.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nTo be fair, besides Bhaalist Armour, you can use anything that looks cool or imposing. The build has huge bonuses to dexterity, all armor proficiencies, so take anything that fancies you.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nTo be fair, all of these gloves have their pros and cons. The main question would be what headwear you are wearing, and pick based on that. If you have Helmet of Arcane Acuity, go for Legacy of the Masters. If you are using Diadem of Arcane Synergy go for Gloves of Baneful Striking. The Helldusk Gloves are an alternative in case you cannot get Legacy of the Masters.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are an exception as they have a buggy mechanic of doubling damage instances on crit hits. This can result in some ridiculous damage if your party has a member who can apply Hold Person​/Hold Monster​ for a 100% crit chance.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe Boots of Stormy Clamour would be the best option, but they are contested, especially by clerics. If you have one in the party, go for any other recommendation or even the ones from previous acts.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of damage, Broodmother's Revenge is the best. Amulet of The Devout is also useful as it improves Spell Save DC and Arcane Arrow success. However, I would prioritize this on Cleric or any other caster.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nDeals weapon damage as 1d4, which can be doubled thanks to Aura Of Murder.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAn easy source of additional psychic damage. You can get concentration from Guidance, casting it before combat. It also works well with Resonance Stone for double damage. Use it if you are not lazy to do the whole setup thing.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\n+2 radiant damage, use it if it's free and not used by a Cleric.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nMy pick if you decide not to use a Shield\n\n\n-\nI would use rings from previous Acts."

        "Until you obtain Shadow Blade,​ feel free to use any weapon that you can get your hands on. If possible, it can be with +1 enchantment for higher attack rolls. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nCan be summoned by casting Shadow Blade​ from level 3.\n\n\nAny +1 weapon\nGet any weapon with +1 enchantment or with the highest damage rolls - Rapier, Longsword, etc.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nGives bonuses to Saving Throws if you have Absolute's brand from the Priestess in the Goblin Camp\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is outright the best headwear for Hexblade throughout most of the game. It gives Arcane Synergy,​ which boosts damage.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor for Act 1 will give good protection and Reeling​ effect when enemies attack you.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\nGives a slight damage reduction against slashing damage.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe item is a solid one for early Act 1. You can remove it from Lae'zel.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nGives an easy way to apply Baneful Strike,​ which enables your casters (or yourself) to increase the chance of spell success.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nA decent source of higher Dexterity and a bonus to attack rolls. In a sense, this is +1 to AC (as you already have 16 Dexterity) and +1 to attack rolls boost.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGives additional armour class for survivability.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nPretty good gloves as they give an easy Advantage, however, Shadow Blade already provides it on Lightly Obscured​ targets, so the benefit is marginal in my opinion.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves against ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game with all the bonuses and easy use of Misty Step.\n\n\nBoots of Elemental Momentum\nWith the use of Booming Blade,​ you can easily activate these boots and greatly improve the hexblade's mobility.\n\n\nLinebreaker Boots\nThese boots can be combined with Expeditious Retreat​ spell to get a damage boost from Wrath. The unfortunate part is that you are limited by spell slot use, and I would use them on smites at this stage in the game.\n\n\nThe Speedy Lightfeet\nSimilar to Linebreaker Boots can be activated with Expeditious Retreat.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nAllows movement without limits on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nCan be easily activated thanks to Booming Blade​ on the first attack. Wear this or Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nExcellent ring with a boost to damage via psychic damage rider. You will need a concentration spell for this.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThe majority of Act 1 doesn't offer that many good ring options. So use these when you acquire them.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\n\n\nRing of Protection"

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nContinues to be the best weapon\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nIf you are up for dual-wielding, especially early on, this can be a decent off-hand pick. Still, I prefer the shield at this time in the game.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters, as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nShield of Devotion\nGives a free spell slot that can be used by the Shield​ spell.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it, you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply some control spells or weaken enemies.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nStill serves as the best headwear in terms of damage boost. If another character is using it, an alternative is Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nAllows stacking Arcane Acuity​ for increased Spell Save DC. This allows casting spells with a higher success chance.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIt can give a marginal boost to damage with a decrease in critical hit rolls.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nA distant option to improve Spell Save DC and initiative. I would say this is a low priority and would rather use this on a dedicated caster.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nOne of my favourite armors for the game in terms of looks. They also come with good boosts like Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws and Shar's Aegis.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nPotent Robe\nExcellent option for Act 2. The additional charisma modifier bonus is great for Shadow Blade + Booming Blade​ and Eldritch Blast. You will also need Armour of Shadows​ invocation and cast Mage Armour​ to have a decent Armour Class, otherwise, enemies will gang up on you as an easy target.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThe armor is still a solid choice for Act 2 with Reeling​ effect and immunity to critical hits.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nComes with full dexterity bonus to Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAll of these gauntlets are great options as they give a permanent damage rider. Just choose which damage you prefer - fire or necrotic.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThe gloves can be useful to get Arcane Acuity​ with Shadow Blade attack.\n\n\nBraindrain Gloves\nCan be excellent gloves for weakening foes, sadly, in terms of damage, they provide minimal improvements and they are obtained at the end of Act 2.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still extremely good.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nSilver Pendant\nGives an option for easy Concentration spell (precast it before combat) to activate Strange Conduit Ring.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best rings, but you have to have a Concentration spell active - Hunger of Hadar, Elemental Weapon, Expeditious Retreat, etc.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA very good ring that inherits damage from your weapon and works especially well in Act 2.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nCan be easily activated thanks to Booming Blade​ on the first attack.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill good options from Act 1, that prove useful, especially in the first hours.\n\n\nRing of Protection"

        "Here, I see multiple setups that you can do with the Hexblade build. I would like to list two that I think are the most relevant and offer good setup options: Shadow Blade Hunter This setup goes hard on Psychic damage and utilizes its gear fully for maximum melee combat effectiveness. This shines if you have another controller like Fire Sorcerer, Sorcadin, etc., to apply Hold Monster​/Hold Person and guarantee 100% critical hits. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThe creme-de-la-creme of the build, it gets ridiculously powerful with level 5 spell slots, add Resonance Stone, and you get double damage.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nOnly used to buff your main weapon with Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nBelm(BiS)\nThe goal is to equip Belm in off-hand, which gives Perfectly Balanced Strike​ and fully replicates main-hand weapon damage. The distant second option is Rhapsody with its Scarlet Remittance​ effect. Otherwise, before these, just use a Shield.\n\n\nRhapsody\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed. I would only use this if you are concentrating on melee attacks and spell casting.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nThe second option, which slightly improves damage by giving a bonus to critical hit chance\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nThe shields are relevant only until you obtain the dual-wielding gear options - Belm or Rhapsody.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy(BiS)\nBoth of these work. In theory, Diadem of Arcane Synergy can help you reach higher total damage, as you unlock ring slots by not using Ring of Arcane Synergy. However, in practice, Birthright can be useful as it raises Charisma and gives other benefits besides damage.\n\n\nBirthright\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Agility\nWith this armor, you can get a full Dexterity bonus to Armour Class, which gives a good survivability boost.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nIn terms of AC, this can be a decrease, however, if you are the only melee character and have archers in the group, they can greatly benefit from the Aura Of Murder​ effect.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Acts armors\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters(BiS)\nThe top gloves for martial builds, which rely on hitting with weapons. They add a bonus to attack rolls and damage.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves can be ridiculously overpowered if you can guarantee critical hits.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives additional fire damage and slightly boosts Spell Save DC.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Persistence(BiS)\nTo be fair, any of these will work and are excellent boot choices. The Boots of Striding can shine if you cast the Concentration spell and use them together with Strange Conduit Ring. Otherwise, Boots of Persistence give everything you need.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nBoots of Striding\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nIn terms of offensive power, it is the best option.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nCan be used to negate the effect of Resonance Stone.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIncrease HP and gives an advantage on Constitution saves.\n\n\n-\nOptions from previous acts\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring(BiS)\nThese rings are the best picks in terms of pure damage, as they deal psychic damage and will work well with Resonance Stone. Just remember to use the Concentration spell to activate Strange Conduit Ring - Elemental Weapon, Hunger of Hadar, etc.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy and helps improve damage by applying Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nCan work together with Broodmother's Revenge to apply the poison effect automatically during combat.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nIf your group doesn't have party members that can apply Hold Monster​/Hold Person, this ring can be used to deal maximum damage using Shadow Blade.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives additional protection for improved survivability Gish setup There is another possibility of both attacking and then casting illusion/enchantment spells with a bonus action - Hold Monster, Hypnotic Pattern, etc. Mostly, this can be done with two specific items, but this requires juggling around other gear: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nShield\nRhapsody\nOffhand option for the good bonuses of \n\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nAs a bonus action is taken by Band of the Mystic Scoundrel effect, shield is a perfect option.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nGives an easy way to stack Arcane Acuity, which is then used to cast a spell with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel.\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nAllows casting with bonus action illusion and enchantment spells, this includes ultimate control spells - Hold Monster, Confusion, Hold Person, etc.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy and helps improve damage by applying Arcane Synergy."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nCan be summoned every long rest by casting Shadow Blade​ from level 3.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA solid stat stick weapon, giving an increased chance of critical hits.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis weapon can be wielded in both hands. It is useful due to Phalar Aluve: Melody,​ which allows you to buff your allies in terms of damage or attack rolls. If using it, I would recommend taking Elixir of Hill Giant Strength + Great Weapon Master: All In​ for a big damage boost in the early game.\n\n\nHunter's Dagger\nIt can be dual-wielded with Shadow Blade. The main point is the Ruptured​ effect, which damages enemies while they move.\n\n\nAny +1 weapon\nGet any weapon with +1 enchantment or with the highest damage rolls - Rapier, Longsword, Staff, etc., before you obtain Shadow Blade.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nExcellent headwear that gives Arcane Synergy. You can easily trigger it with Booming Blade.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nI think this is the best Act 1 armour, as it gives +2 Dexterity, which translates into multiple benefits. Make sure to cast Mage Armour​ on yourself.\n\n\nSpidersilk Armour\nThe main problem with Bladesinging is that you are limited to Cloth or Light Armour. This leaves you with not that many options in Act 1. If using cloth, remember to apply Mage Armour.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nGives an easy way to apply Baneful Strike,​ which enables your casters (or yourself) to increase the chance of spell success.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nA decent source of higher Dexterity and a bonus to attack rolls. In a sense, this is +1 to AC (as you already have 16 Dexterity) and +1 to attack rolls boost. You can also respec and dump dexterity to 8, but these gloves are only useful until you reach a major settlement in Act 2.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nPretty good gloves as they give an easy Advantage, however, Shadow Blade already provides it on Lightly Obscured​ targets, so the benefit is marginal in my opinion.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nAs you might not wear any type of armor for most of Act 1, these gloves are great for improved armour class.\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGives additional armour class for survivability.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game with all the bonuses and easy use of Misty Step.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots can easily apply Reverberation​ via Booming Blade. Still, these might be taken by the Cleric if you have one in the group.\n\n\nLinebreaker Boots\nThese boots can be combined with Expeditious Retreat​ spell to get a damage boost from Wrath. This is especially good if you want to embrace the melee combat.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nAllows movement without limits on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nUse this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The Arcane Synergy​ effect is easy to activate with Booming Blade.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1."
      ],
      "2": [
        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nContinues to be the best weapon\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nIf you are up for dual-wielding, especially early on, this can be a decent off-hand pick. Still, I prefer the shield at this time in the game.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nI think this weapon can still play a significant role even in Act 2. The buff is significant for many of the fights here.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nStill serves as the best headwear in terms of damage boost. If another character is using it, an alternative is Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nAllows stacking Arcane Acuity​ for increased Spell Save DC. This allows casting spells with a higher success chance.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIt can give a marginal boost to damage with a decrease in critical hit rolls.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nA distant option to improve Spell Save DC and initiative. I would say this is a low priority and would rather use this on a dedicated caster.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nStudded Leather Armour +2\nIt can be obtained late in Act 2, once you reach level 9. Solid armor, the main draw is its decent 15 Armour Class.\n\n\nMoon Devotion Robe\nI will be called evil for recommending it. Still, this is a great armor with a Constitution Saving throw advantage and a free Lunar Bulwark.\n\n\nShadeclinger Armour\nThe advantage to saving throws is usually overlooked. Still, this is an excellent bonus, enabling better spell and various effects resistance.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAll of these gauntlets are great options as they give a permanent damage rider. Just choose which damage you prefer - fire or necrotic.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThe gloves can be useful to get Arcane Acuity​ with Shadow Blade attack.\n\n\nBraindrain Gloves\nCan be excellent gloves for weakening foes, sadly, in terms of damage, they provide minimal improvements, and they are obtained at the end of Act 2.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still extremely good.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best rings. The main problem is that you might not have Concentration active all the time. If that is the case, check other ring options.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA very good ring that inherits damage from your weapon and works especially well in Act 2.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nCan be easily activated thanks to Booming Blade​ on the first attack. Use this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill good options from Act 1 that prove useful, especially in the first hours.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nProvides +1 Armour Class to avoid hits."
      ],
      "3": [
        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThe creme-de-la-creme of the build, it gets ridiculously powerful with level 5 spell slots, add Resonance Stone, and you get double damage.\n\n\nCrimson Mischief\nAnother weapon option if you want an alternative to Shadow Blade. This deals a lot of piercing damage, so using it together with Bhaalist Armour is mandatory.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nAnother weapon that can be used together with Bhaalist Armour. However, you should keep the off-hand empty to get all the benefits from it.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nOnly used to buff your main weapon with Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nBelm\nThe goal is to equip Belm in off-hand, which gives Perfectly Balanced Strike​ and fully replicates main-hand weapon damage. The distant second option is Rhapsody with its Scarlet Remittance​ effect.\n\n\nRhapsody\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThe dagger's critical damage bonus applies even if you are not attacking with it. You can easily guarantee critical hits with Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nThe ultimate bow for a stat stick. It gives a special effect, which inflicts additional critical damage with any weapon hit. You can easily guarantee critical hits with Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed. I would only use this if you are concentrating on melee attacks and spell casting.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe +1 initiative is still good.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nHands down the best helmet, works extremely well with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel. You pump up Arcane Acuity, making your spell success chance very high. After that, follow up with a bonus action for instant success!\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn case the other options are taken or you have not acquired them. Use this or Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nThis is a solid armor, which is more intended for a pure caster. Still, I think it is relevant for Bladesinger with bonuses to Spell Save DC, and Advantage on Constitution Saves. This allows for better management of spell concentration.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nThe armor serves a few purposes. First, it has a good armour class and gives an initiative bonus. However, the highlight is Aura Of Murder, which gives piercing vulnerability, making your archers deal double damage. On top of that, if you decide to use items that proc on Condition, like Diadem of Arcane Synergy, this results in instant activation. I also like this armour because, on the fly, you can switch to something like Crimson Mischief when you are fighting Steel Watchers.\n\n\nRobe of Supreme Defences\nImproves spell concentration as you get a bonus to saving throws.\n\n\nGloves\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are very powerful if you can guarantee critical hits with spells like Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nSets strength to 23, which scales with Shadow Blade as the main weapon stat.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives additional fire damage and slightly boosts Spell Save DC.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThese remain the best boots in terms of their usefulness and various bonuses\n\n\n-\nBoots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of offensive power, it is the best option.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nGives +2 Spell Save DC, which is a significant bonus. However, this might be in demand by your cleric or other casters.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIncrease HP and gives an advantage on Constitution saves. It works extremely well with Helmet of Grit for an additional bonus action\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nCan be used to negate the effect of Resonance Stone.\n\n\n-\nOptions from previous acts\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nI would say this is the best pick and almost mandatory. It will help you to cast spells like Hold Person, Hold Monster, and Hypnotic Pattern​ with just a bonus action. So you can freely attack, build up Arcane Acuity,​ and land a spell to disable multiple foes.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy and helps improve damage by applying Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThese rings are the best picks in terms of pure damage, as they deal psychic damage and will work well with Resonance Stone. Just remember to use the Concentration spell to activate Strange Conduit Ring.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nDeals additional damage that is inherited from your weapon. This does require the weapon to be Lightly Obscured, which is easy to achieve.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nCan work together with Broodmother's Revenge to apply the poison effect automatically during combat.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives additional protection for improved survivability. I do think this has very low priority, as Bladesong​ already gives plenty. Battlemage Setup with 2 bonus actions: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nShadow Blade\nThe creme-de-la-creme of the build, it gets ridiculously powerful with level 5 spell slots, add Resonance Stone, and you get double damage.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nBelm\nThe goal is to equip Belm in off-hand, which gives Perfectly Balanced Strike​ and fully replicates main-hand weapon damage. The distant second option is Rhapsody with its Scarlet Remittance​ effect.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThis item can be used together with Amulet of Greater Health + Great Weapon Master: All In​ + Belm, to have 2 usable bonus action points with the main weapon.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThese can help you to obtain more Arcane Acuity​ for improved spell success chance.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIncrease HP and gives an advantage on Constitution saves. It works extremely well with Helmet of Grit for an additional bonus action\n\n\nRings\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nI would say this is the best pick and almost mandatory. It will help you to cast spells like Hold Person, Hold Monster, and Hypnotic Pattern​ with just a bonus action. So you can freely attack, build up Arcane Acuity,​ and land a spell to disable multiple foes.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe ring will be the source of the Arcane Synergy​ buff."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is a perfect weapon from the early game up to the late game. If you want a more \"optimized\" setup, I would go with it. You can also take Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat and wield it with two hands, for a big boost to damage. The highlight is Phalar Aluve: Melody,​ which allows you to buff allies or debuff enemies, depending on what is needed more.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nSimilar to Phalar Aluve, it can be used effectively with high Dexterity and comes with a unique area attack.\n\n\nThe Skinburster\nVery special weapon, that works well to better sustain Warding Bond​ effects with damage decrease via Force Conduit. Again, this would need Elixir of Hill Giant Strength before you unlock Hexblade.\n\n\nUnseen Menace\nThese weapons are go-to picks if you want other options, especially for more damage. You would need to use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to wear these effectively.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\n\n\nSword of Justice\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear for pure weapon damage increase.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nGet this helmet, as it will be useful later on.\n\n\nWapira's Crown\nWorks well with Turn the Tide​ and can help sustain the damage from Warding Bond.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nMy go-to pick if you decide to utilize the Oath of Crown Paladin spell - Warding Bond. The armor helps reduce damage and better sustain incoming damage.\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nMake sure to get this armor as it will prove valuable later on. It can be used now, as you will apply Radiating Orb​ with Divine Smite.\n\n\nGloves\nHellrider's Pride\nBest gloves if you are using The Whispering Promise + Turn the Tide​ to buff allies. These gloves will apply Blade Ward​ in addition to Bless.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nMake sure to get these gloves. For now, I would say they are not as important, but will become so later.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nBe sure to get these, as they will play a major role later on.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source, for the mid-game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nExcellent ring to easily apply Bless​ when using Turn the Tide.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nRing of Salving\nHelps with making Turn the Tide​ heal slightly stronger.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit."

        "Pre Level 9 Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nContinues to be the best sword with its buff until you reach level 9.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nA weapon option if you want something new, but it requires using the Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\n-\nPrevious Act headwear\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nIf using Warding Bond,​ this continues to be the best armor.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nSomewhat inferior armor option if you skipped Adamantine Splint Armour.\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nMedium armour options, if you are not using Warding Bond. Luminous Armour synergizes well with Divine Smite​ in applying Radiating Orb.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for damage boost.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasy radiant damage boost.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nAn excellent way to gain an easy advantage. Useful until you get Spirit Guardians,​ where maintaining concentration will be essential.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nStill a useful ring for buffing allies with Bless.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks. Now, from level 9, once you get Spirit Guardians,​ this is the recommended item setup: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nOne of the best helmets for revorb setup, when enemies miss, further applying Reverberation​ when using Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nHelps apply the Radiating Orb​ effect on multiple enemies at the same time.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThe best gloves for Reverberation​ via the radiant damage sources.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAnother option to apply Radiating Orb, but I would say using it together with Luminous Armour is overkill.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots for applying Reverberation​ from any condition effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nUse the amulet when you want to restore a level 3 spell slot. It can be removed after use.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nAn easy way to apply radiant damage together with Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nStill a useful ring for buffing allies with Bless.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAn easy way to get a crit hit for Divine Smite."

      "3": [
        "There are plenty of gear variations here, and it all depends on how much you want to lean into weapon damage, revorb, and support side. For example, items like The Whispering Promise + The Reviving Hands are excellent for support, but this might not be needed in Act 3. Gloves of Belligerent Skies + Ring of Mental Inhibition + Boots of Stormy Clamour + Luminous Armour allows for constant debuffs, weakening foes, and forcing them Prone. Or you can wear items that buff damage like Legacy of the Masters, Strange Conduit Ring, and improve weapon capabilities. As you can see, there are various choices, so pick the ones that best fit your party and gear availability. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThis continues to be the best weapon in terms of provided buffs. Still, as you have Spirit Guardians​ and two attacks, the main action point gets contested. I would only use this weapon if you do precasting for Phalar Aluve: Melody or are Hastened; otherwise, go for other options.\n\n\nThe Skinburster\nIt works the same as already mentioned in Act 1 equipment, and gives the build more sturdiness with Force Conduit.\n\n\nNyrulna\nThese are the best weapons if you have a way of getting Aura Of Murder​ from Bhaalist Armour. The best source is another martial build that stays in melee. The main outlier would be Duellist's Prerogative, which does not need Great Weapon Master: All In, allowing to substitute the feat for something like Ability Improvement, Alert,​ or Tough. Nyrulna is a very nice weapon option, as it has weapon actions that apply conditions which trigger revorb items, debuffing everyone again...\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\n\n\nThe Dancing Breeze\nTwo-handed Finesse weapon that has Whirlwind Attack. This allows you to hit each enemy with Divine Smite, but eats your spell slots very fast.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nCool looking greatsword, which comes with a caveat. It requires strength, and this means you should use the Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength to get its full effect.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nContinues to be my favourite helmet option for enemies that dare to attack you.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nGives Blinded​ immunity and disables enemy critical hits.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nGives an easy way to obtain Arcane Synergy​ to boost damage.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis helmet works well with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel for casting spells like Command​ via bonus action. The main problem is that Paladin is too low on spell slots to use this effectively.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nGives immunity to critical hits and heals every turn.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves chances of avoiding attacks from enemies, in turn activating Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverberation, this cloak will make it easy to activate its effect.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for applying Radiating Orb​ debuffs when using Spirit Guardians​\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThe best gloves for Reverberation​ via the radiant damage sources.\n\n\nThe Reviving Hands\nUpgraded version of Hellrider's Pride. Together with Turn the Tide,​ this can be used to easily apply Blade Ward​ on all group members, including you.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nBoots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nI would say this is the best amulet overall. It makes it easy to maintain Concentration, and makes it reasonable to use Divine Allegiance​ if you want to.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Acts amulets\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nStraightforward damage boost on each hit that you will do.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nThis ring has a good synergy with Champion Challenge, applying Mental Fatigue​ on successful effect, and further weakening foes for your casters.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nWith Booming Blade,​ you can now easily activate the ring for Arcane Synergy. Use this or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. I would pick this if you want to put more emphasis on melee hits.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nIf you are still using Turn the Tide,​ this ring can successfully continue to boost allies' stats. If you want to be more of a debuffer, there are other options below.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nA more offensive ring option, as you will be concentrating on Spirit Guardians,​ it has easy activation.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThis ring is perfect with Helmet of Arcane Acuity, which allows casting spells like Command​ with just a bonus action. However, I think Paladin is too limited by its spell slot amount for this to be worthwhile.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAn easy way to get a crit hit for Divine Smite."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2. Sunbeam​ is also a powerful spell to get this early in the game.\n\n\nStaff of Arcane Blessing\nThis works together with The Whispering Promise and increases spell attack rolls, making it easier to land Inflict Wounds.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nA solid weapon that will increase spell attack rolls and help land Inflict Wounds​ more easily.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody​ before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives an easy advantage against Monstrosity-type enemies.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.

Moreover, it will also activate any Reverberation​ effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor pick, for most of the game, later you will get more options, for the necrotic theme.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverberation​ stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet in the early game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs to your allies.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Healing Word​ or Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe ring will prove useful once you obtain Booming Blade​ from sorcerer dip. This way, you can get a decent damage boost with Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from the Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability. This improves the chances of activating the Holy Lance Helm\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nGives +1 damage boost on 5 Reverberation​ stacks detonation."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nContinue using weapons from Act 1, as nothing comes close in terms of usefulness.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nObtain this weapon as it is one of the best options for buffing yourself with elemental damage via Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nRanged\n-\nBows from the previous Act.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nIt can be useful to precast Haste​ in some encounters.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters, as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it, you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC, improving spell success. This is not a hugely important item, so you can give this to another caster and continue using the previous act gear.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverberation,​ this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStill the best gloves for the Cleric.\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThese gloves can be used to stack Arcane Acuity​ via Spirit Guardians. This helps you to land any other spells, and specifically Inflict Wounds​ for high single-target damage. Credits: Bluemajere\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill, the best boots are in terms of applying to various conditions.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nContinues to provide good value.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet for Honour Mode runs, reducing your chances of wiping.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis is a key item to make the necrotic Spirit Guardians​ work well. Be sure to cast Light​ on yourself. This gives a radiant damage rider, meaning that your other revorb items (Luminous Armour, Gloves of Belligerent Skies) will still activate, applying Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring is useful if you are buffing allies via healing.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nContinues to be a solid option for movement speed.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds Dazed​ effect that can be proc after 5 Reverberation​ stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nStaff of Cherished Necromancy\nThe best staff choice for the necrotic theme. This gives Life Essence,​ which allows for a free necromancy spell cast. It is best used with level 6 Inflict Wounds​ + Channel Divinity: Touch of Death. Moreover, thanks to Shillelagh​ + Booming Blade,​ you can effectively use this as a melee weapon.\n\n\nTorch of Revocation\nAnother thematic weapon that also deals both necrotic and fire damage.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role, giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a solid boost to initiative.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nImproves initiative.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nAs you will be hitting occasionally with a weapon, this will improve critical chances.\n\n\nHead\nHorns of the Berserker\nOne of the rare headwear, that gives a direct damage boost. Thankfully, this is a necrotic one, which fits well with the whole build theme.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will cover enemies with Reverberation, this gives a chance to apply Dazed​ on foes.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nIn terms of combat potential, this is still a powerful armor choice as it applies Radiating Orb​ effects.\n\n\nArmour of the Sporekeeper\nA flavourful armor choice which provides a few benefits. First, it improves spellcasting stats; second, it gives a necrotic damage boost (albeit small). Last, it gives Haste Spores​ while the Symbiotic Entity​ is active.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nImproves the damage of your melee attacks and spellcasting stats, to easier to land spells.\n\n\nGemini Gloves\nThese gloves have a special interaction with Toll the Dead. When activating its Adroit Caster​ passive, the cantrip gets an AOE effect. This makes it a potent once-per-short-rest damage option if enemies get stacked.\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThese gloves can be used to stack Arcane Acuity​ via Spirit Guardians. This helps you to land any other spells, and specifically Inflict Wounds​ for high single-target damage. Credits: Bluemajere\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nContinues to help with stacking Reverberation.\n\n\nThe Reviving Hands\nLeans more into the support side, applying Blade Ward​ for everyone.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nBest offensive boosts, helping to build Reverberation​ stacks.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nOne of the best boots makes it easy to move across various terrains and resist effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots makes it easy to move across various terrains and resist effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe ultimate cleric amulet gives an additional Channel Divinity charge.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nA solid defensive amulet to help resist spell effects.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis is a key item to make the necrotic Spirit Guardians​ work well. Be sure to cast Light​ on yourself. This gives a radiant damage rider, meaning that your other revorb items (Luminous Armour, Gloves of Belligerent Skies) will still activate, applying Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe ring can help you improve melee weapon damage via Arcane Synergy. The main problem is that it might not always activate, so test it, and decide if you would like to use it.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring is useful if you are buffing allies via healing.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nContinues to be a solid option for movement speed.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds a Dazed​ effect that can be proc after 5 Reverberation​ stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for supporting classes, especially those that might not even need to attack with weapons. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody​ before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2. Sunbeam​ is also a powerful spell to get this early in the game.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nImproves spell success chance, but I would prioritize this on other casters if you have them.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +1\nThis is my go-to weapon for the early game on Bard. You will have limited spell slots, and attacking with a bow can keep you at a safe distance and give good use for a bonus action.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a Reeling​ effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from True Soul Priestess Gut (Lv. 4) in Goblin Camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any Reverberation​ effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nGet this armor; you will most likely not wear it before getting Druid multiclass for medium armor proficiency. Another option is to have the Githyanki race as a choice for Meidum Armor proficiency.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best armor before you get medium armor proficiency.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverberation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Bard heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverberation​ stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best healing amulet in the early game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs to your allies.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nGives a way to restore spell slots.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a healer early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Healing Word​ or Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from the Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability. This improves the chances of activating the Holy Lance Helm\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nGives +1 damage boost on 5 Reverberation​ stacks detonation."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nAct 1 weapons are still your best options\n\n\nShadow Lantern\nCan summon a Wraith that helps in combat.\n\n\nRanged\n-\nBows from the previous Act.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nIt can be useful to precast Haste​ in some encounters.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nContinues to be a solid option with its stacked bonus effects.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it, you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nContinues to be the best helmet option.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverberation,​ this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for effectively utilizing the Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThe core item of this build enables stacking Spell Save DC and using concentrationless control spells like Command​ with a 100 % success chance.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill, the best boots for applying Reverberation​ via various spell conditions.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nContinues to provide good value, in case you want to have a healing option on hand.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet for Honour Mode runs, reducing your chances of wiping.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nContinues to be a solid option for movement speed.\n\n\nRing of Exalted Marrow\nGives Exhort the Risen​ spell, which allows control of undead enemies. Specifically useful against Apostle of Myrkul.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring is useful if you are buffing allies via healing. I would have this equipped if you have the Amulet of Restoration.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nApplies Mental Fatigue​ when using spells, mainly with Dazzling Breath.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis ring can add additional radiant damage to Spirit Guardians. It can be especially useful with necrotic Spirit Guardians​ on enemies that have Radiant Retort, and you want to avoid high damage reflections, but still apply Reverberation​ or Radiating Orb.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds Dazed​ effect that can be proc after 5 Reverberation​ stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

The Phalar Aluve: Shriek​ is the best option now, as it boosts spell success chance and gives additional damage riders.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role, giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nContinues to be one of the best options, in activating conditions and avoiding crit hits.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a solid boost to initiative.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nImproves initiative.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nGives an easy way to inflict radiant damage, further applying various item effects.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will cover enemies with Reverberation, this gives a chance to apply Dazed​ on foes.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour(BiS)\nContinues to be the best armor choice\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power(BiS)\nThe core item of this build enables stacking Spell Save DC and using concentrationless control spells like Command​ with a 100 % success chance.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nBest offensive boosts, helping to build Reverberation​ stacks.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nOne of the best boots makes it easy to move across various terrains and resist effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots makes it easy to move across various terrains and resist effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nFey Semblance Amulet\nA solid defensive amulet to help resist spell effects.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nContinues to be a solid option for movement speed.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nAlthough it does not work with Spirit Guardians,​ it does get activated with Dazzling Breath.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nFurther boosts Armour class, enabling you to avoid enemy attacks\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds a Dazed​ effect that can be proc after 5 Reverberation​ stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best stat stick weapon for ranged builds in Act 1. Does not require any special features or activations.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis can be an option to activate before combat. The Sing action will give increased attack rolls and counteract Sharpshooter: All In.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +1\nThese weapons can be dual-wielded, making them perfect very early in the game. Use this before obtaining better ones. What makes this good is that it can use bonus action for additional damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helm\nProvides a bonus Saving Throw while obscured, which is great for avoiding the effects of some spells.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nIncreases movement speed at the start of the combat for 3 turns. I think this is the best helmet for Act 1, if you are using melee attacks.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nOnly obtainable if you have Dark Urge Origin. After killing an enemy it gives invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nGives +2 Dexterity (up to a maximum of 20). This will improve your rolls and damage. As this is Cloth it provides only 10 Armour Class.\n\n\nSpidersilk Armour\nAs there are not many good choices for light armour this is somewhat decent.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Archery\nBest gloves for Ranged attacks.\n\n\nGloves of Power\nGives a bonus to Sleight of Hand for better picklock chances. Moreover, applies the status effect, and penalizes the target.\n\n\nGloves of Thievery\nAlthough nothing fancy for combat, these are amazing for Pickpocketing, Chests, and traps.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nGreat boots that can be used to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nThe Speedy Lightfeet\nCan be used to activate Dash​ before combat for a bit more damage from Lightning Charges.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet that gives a direct damage bonus. However, you will need someone to heal you, this will most likely be a healer or just chug a potion.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives access to Misty Step, in case you need a way to quickly or cover long distances.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIt's easy to activate it as you have multiple spells to concentrate on. This will result in bonus psychic damage.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThis is a very powerful ring, that may be useful even till the end game, due to flat bonus damage.\n\n\nFetish of Callarduran Smoothhands\nAllows casting Invisibility​ that can be used to approach combat in the perfect position.\n\n\nSmuggler's Ring\nAlthough this does not provide any combat bonuses, it is very useful in world exploration and pickpocketing."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nStill, the main stat stick to improve crit range and damage rolls.\n\n\nRanged\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nThe best Hand crossbow in Act 2, comes with +2 Enchantment.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\nExcellent hand crossbow that comes with force damage. Only a handful of enemies can resist it, and it will be useful up until the middle of Act 3.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nCan be used as a stat stick to almost guarantee always going first.\n\n\nHead\nMarksmanship Hat\nThe best headwear if you are doing ranged setup, as it will increase hit chance. In Act 3 it loses most of its value.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIncreases the success likelihood of critical chance while obscured. This means that you should stand in lightly dimmed places.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIncreases the success likelihood of critical chance while obscured. This means that you should stand in lightly dimmed places.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nCan still be used in Act 2 as the invisibility effect is just that good.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nA very good cloak, with a good bonus to Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nGives an advantage on stealth checks and +2 dexterity, up to 20. One of the best armors for ranaged characters.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nUpgraded version of the below armor, the casting of Shield of Faith​ is a great way to obtain bonus damage from Strange Conduit Ring and some additional survivability. It also looks cool!\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nYou can get a bonus 2 Armour Class from Shield of Faith​ to improve survivability. Moreover, you get an Advantage on Stealth checks.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis medium armor does not impose any disadvantage on stealth and gives bonus initiative rolls. It can give the highest armor class with high Dexterity until later in Act 3.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nThe improved version of Dark Justiciar Gauntlets also allows casting Darkness spells.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus 1d4 fire damage with weapon attacks and can inflict bleeding. The best choice early in Act 2.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nGives a bonus of 1d4 Necrotic damage with weapon attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nStill an amazing option for the Gloomstalker Assasin Build\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives bonus Armour Class. A good survivability choice, but not mandatory in my opinion.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nVery interesting choice. Because the build will deal a decent amount of critical hits, this will allow it to paralyze many humanoid enemies. Give this one a try.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe amulet will be a good option until endgame as the 1d6 poison damage is a good boost. However, it does not allow coatings, so be sure to check for alternatives if you plan on using them.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nThis is a bit more powerful than the ring below, but it requires your foes to be at least lightly obscured.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThe bonus damage is a good choice even in Act 2.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nJust a mention of this ring. I do not think it is the best choice but could be useful, especially if you do not take Assassin and go with the Thief subclass instead."

        "Act 3 is where the build will get the best items, to maximize its effectiveness and damage. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRhapsody\nOne of the best stat stick weapons in the whole game. It is in high demand by multiple builds.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThis dagger is kind of bugged, and the bonus critical damage gets applied even when attacking with ranged attacks.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nStill a relevant stat stick weapon from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +2\nThis is an improved version that you can dual wield with another hand crossbow, for an offensive option using bonus action.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nProvides additional attack via bonus action. use Transfuse Health​ to quickly reach the HP threshold.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nWill boost your damage based on the spellcasting modifier. If it is 14 Wisdom, this will result in bonus 2. However, I would limit this item to Paladin if you have it in your group. If not - use it! You will also need to do a respec. Start with Fighter or Rogue and pick Ranger as the last class, so that your spellcasting modifier becomes Wisdom.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIf using Broodmother's Revenge, this helmet's effect ensures that you get bonus damage on every combat encounter.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nA perfect mantle to constantly get invisible after an enemy kills. Still a solid option for Act 3.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nEnsures good survivability, by imposing a disadvantage on attacker Attack Rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis armor is particularly powerful for melee-piercing weapon wielders - these include daggers and short swords.  It makes them vulnerable to piercing damage unless they have resistance to it. Moreover, it gives bonus initiative, ensuring that you will go first most of the time.\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nThe best armor if not using Bhaalist Armour and not having access to Auntie Ethel's Hair. This will set Dexterity to 20.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThis medium armor perfectly works with stealth as it does not impose any disadvantages. Moreover, it has a decent armor class for protection.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters(BiS)\nOne of the best gloves in the game, however, could have limited access based on your decisions in the game.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese gloves provide bonuses for every attack. You will be doing many of them so the bonus fire damage stacks up\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nIncur 6d6 damage, but gain additional attack points. This neatly fits into the Stealthy playstyle as you can deal damage bonuses on the first turn.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nThese boots have a wide array of uses - allowing succeeding Saving Throws while using Reaction, a teleportation spell, and ignoring difficult terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives Freedom of Movement​ and Longstrider​ actions effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nBonus poison damage on each hit with the weapon is a great improvement\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nA powerful choice for Act 3 as it will guarantee paralysis and critical hits from the melee range.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring(BiS)\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nA great ring for bonus damage, but requires your foes to be lightly obscured.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAmazing choice till the end of the game as each attack will apply this bonus acid damage."

Although it may be boring, it will cause significant damage and make encounters easier. Try to get it at levels 3-4.\n\n\nDoom Hammer\nDefinitely get this weapon as it can be useful later in Act 2, when fighting the Apostle of Myrkul to disable his health regeneration.\n\n\nJavelin +1\nIn case you lose Returning Pike you can stock up on these.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHunting Shortbow\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above.\n\n\nShield\n-\nThe build does not need a shield in Act 1.\n\n\nHead\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat. However, this is better used on other frontliner as you are not so reliant on movement speed.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nPowerful armour from Grymforge, which is best worn with at least 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. It's a very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nIt can be used as an armor option once you have The Sparkle Hands. However, this is first and foremost caster item, so I would prioritize it there.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Sparkle Hands\nExcellent glove options are one of the best options throughout the game. Thanks to Elemental Cleaver,​ you can stack 4 Lightning Charges​ on one attack. Later with Lightning Jabber, this increases to 6!\n\n\nGloves of Uninhibited Kushigo\nVery powerful gloves that ensure you deal bonus damage. They will lead you through most of the playthrough.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and, most importantly, unlocks Misty Step​ with each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding \nNo impact when moving on difficult terrain, which allows you to position yourself for perfect shots.\n\n\nAmulet\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nThe amulet can help avoid death.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nGives an easy way to apply vulnerabilities via bonus action.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nDoes not require you to use Spell Slot to cast Misty Step, to either get away or reserve a better throwing position.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThe best ring for Act 1, and it will be used up until Act 3.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive, so be sure to pickpocket some traders.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws."

        "Here, the build can start taking a more advanced shape, mainly as you will have Elemental Cleaver​ at your disposal from level 6. I would like to emphasize a few item setups to give some variations to the build: Revorb debuffer I would recommend these items if you don't have a cleric or other Spirit Guardians​ user. Just make sure that targets are illuminated (Light, Dancing Lights, etc.) to activate the Callous Glow Ring. This way, you can do some debuffing with Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation. For Elemental Cleaver,​ you can take either lightning or thunder. If you are using Returning Pike, otherwise, with Lightning Jabber, any of them work, even cold. Here are the item recommendations: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nCan help apply Radiating Orb​ when enemies miss attacking you.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nAn optional item, that can help to apply even more debuffs against enemies who attack you.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is one of the best cleric armors, so this setup relies on either you not having a cleric or making some kind of other variation. Otherwise, this armor option is too expensive to pass up, as it will not be as effective on Giant Barb.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThese gloves will give stacks of Reverberation​ from either lightning, radiant or thunder damage.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nApplies the Radiating Orb​ condition on attack.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots will be activated from one of the above items, to give further 2 stacks of Reverberation.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis item gives an easy source of radiant damage, allowing to apply Radiating Orb​. Ice Giant setup This is another powerful setup that is more aimed at applying control via the creation of ice fields or forcing the Encrusted with Frost​ condition. This is a truly great way to apply Frozen​ in case you reach 7 stacks. Once it is encased in ice, you can use one of the blunt weapons to inflict double damage - Doom Hammer, Dwarven Thrower, etc. To make this all work, use Elemental Cleaver​ ice version, which gives the cold damage rider to activate all of these nice items. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nColdbrim Hat\nThe hat will give stacks of Encrusted with Frost​ together with Winter's Clutches; otherwise, it will not work.\n\n\nGloves\nWinter's Clutches\nYou will have a source of cold damage via Elemental Cleaver​ to apply the condition.\n\n\nRings\nSnowburst Ring\nCreates an ice field when you deal cold damage, making enemies slip and forcing them to skip their turn. Other equipment Here is the standard gear recommendation to continue using. This will emphasize the Lightning damage, as it will give the highest direct damage boost. The good thing is that the weapons in Act 2 allow you to wear a shield, greatly improving your survivability. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nLightning Jabber\nThe best weapon for throwing in Act 2, thanks to the Elemental Cleaver​, just don't use lightning variation as it does not stack with the innate damage rider on weapon.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game. You will get it late in Act 2, but it can be a solid choice until you get the Nyrulna. It is an alternative version of Selûne's Spear of Night. It can return with Elemental Cleaver.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nThe \"good\" decision reward for the major Act 2 event. It is inferior to Shar's Spear of Evening. Still, it can create Difficult Terrain. It only returns if you use Elemental Cleaver​.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nReturning Pike\nIt can be used until you obtain Lightning Jabber. I would still keep this weapon even after that, in case you lose any of the weapons.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste​ without spell slots. Best used before combat, or continue using Act 1 weapons.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nOne of the best shields in the game with immunity to critical hits.\n\n\n-\nBesides that, any uncommon or rare shield will work.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIt increases the critical chance by 5%, and it only requires you to be obscured. Moreover, gives some resistance against spells by providing bonus Saving Throws.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives +1 to attack rolls. This is a minor improvement, especially as you have substantial bonuses from Tavern Brawler​ already.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nProvides a bonus critical chance while obscured. The first helmet in the game that will offer this bonus.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Mighty Cloth\nA solid option, especially until you reach level 8 for the ability improvement feat. Gives a direct damage boost.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nWith it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So while using it, be sure to have 16 Dexterity to utilize its full potential. I think the bonus initiative is better than the Adamantine Scale Mail\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nStill plays a good role in Act 2, as its 16 Armour Class is plenty, especially if you have at least 14 Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Sparkle Hands\nContinues to be the best glove option\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSimilar to the Gloves of Uninhibited Kushigo, but changes the bonus damage to fire.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nContinues to be one of the best boot options.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nThe only amulet that can indirectly help to maximize damage, as you make a humanoid enemyParalysed\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAn alternative to the amulet above gives bonus survivability and allows casting Shield​ with a reaction.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nThis ring still rocks and should always be equipped.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nOne of the best rings in terms of damage.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks, the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasily get bonus damage if creatures are illuminated, this can be done by casting Light​ on yourself by an ally, and let them stand close to the foes."

        "The Ice Giant and Revorb debuffer setups still work, and you can continue using those items up to the final stages of the game. Still, Act 3 provides some good items for specific slots, so let's take a look at them You have an option to wear a shield; however, some items will not work with it, like Bonespike Boots. Still, this should not limit you in case you decide to go for other item options. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nNyrulna\nOne of the best throwing weapons in the game. Comes with neat weapon actions and Thunder Rider. The main issue is that it deals area of effect thunder damage, which can damage both yourself and your allies, or unwanted NPCs.\n\n\nDwarven Thrower\nExcellent throwing weapon, that maximizes its potential when worn by a Dwarf. Especially useful for the Ice Giant setup on Frozen​ targets.\n\n\n-\nThe weapons from previous acts are still powerful, especially if you don't want to deal with Nyrulna area of effect thunder rider.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nGives -1 requirement for critical hit, giving a slight boost to average damage.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a significant initiative boost, but as Barbarian, you already have plenty of it, so I would prioritize this on another party member.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nPowerful shield with various effects and +3 Armour class.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nOne of the best shields in the game with immunity to critical hits.\n\n\n-\nBesides that, any uncommon or rare shield will work.\n\n\nHead\nHorns of the Berserker\nSimple and solid helm option with a direct damage boost.\n\n\nHelmet of Grit\nAllows for obtaining additional bonus action for more attacks. This requires being at 50% HP or lower, so feel free to use something like Transfuse Health​ to maintain this level.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nExcellent helmet, gives immunity to Blinded​ and critical hits, comes with other goodies, making it one of the best headwear options.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nGives critical hit immunity, bonuses to armour class and saving throws.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nThe strongest cloak in the game, with a significant boost to defensive capabilities.\n\n\nArmor\nBonespike Garb\nPretty neat armor that gives temporary HP when you use Giant's Rage. Moreover, it reflects damage, and gets a slight bonus if you have Callous Glow Ring equipped.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nVery powerful armor option, which works well with piercing weapons - Nyrulna, Lightning Jabber, etc. To activate Aura Of Murder,​ you will need to be in close range. So either use a melee companion for that or do this yourself.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nGives a solid armour class boost.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Sparkle Hands\nContinues to be one of the best glove options.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nIf you want to add different types of damage, the gloves are a perfect pick.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nOne of the best boots in the game, giving immunity to Prone​ condition.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nGives additional armour class if not using a shield. Moreover, it has a special action - Brutal Leap, which can force enemies Prone.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nExcellent amulet for boosting health pool and increasing constitution stat. You can respec and set CON to 8 and increase any other ability.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nGreat defensive amulet that gives advantage on metal saving throws.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Flinging\nExcellent ring for a slight damage boost.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives a direct damage boost as long as you are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nGives +2 damage boost"

You may not have much use for it now, but it will synergize extremely well with Callous Glow Ring for additional radiant damage.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nPowerful armour from Grymforge, which is best worn with at least 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel.

Overall, both of these weapons are great choices, as they come with special actions and +3 enchantment.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nAlmost mandatory weapon to have. Use its special action Draconic Elemental Weapon​ to buff your weapon, with thunder/lightning damage rider. This will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and inflict more damage.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste​ without spell slots. Best used before combat, or continue using Act 1 weapons.\n\n\nHead\n-\nSame headwear as from the previous act.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nHelps to absorb elemental damage, which can then improve your weapon attacks.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs many enemies will get Reverberation​ effect from your attacks, the additional Dazed​ from the cloak is a good addition.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armour in terms of applying conditions and debuffs.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nAlternative armour option\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nContinues to be the best glove option.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative glove option, in case Gloves of Belligerent Skies are taken by another party member.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armour class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nContinues to be one of the best boot options.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nThe only amulet that can indirectly help to maximize damage, as you make a humanoid enemyParalysed.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAn alternative to the amulet above gives bonus survivability and allows casting Shield​ with a reaction.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nOne of the most important items for the build. The radiant damage rider will activate Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ from your items, giving tons of conditions to weaken your target. Be sure to illuminate yourself with another caster Light​ cantrip.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nExcellent source of Dazed​ for even more conditions\n\n\nEversight Ring\nGo to the ring option if the party uses Darkness​ spells. This enables the character to freely attack without disadvantage when inside it.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives an easy bonus damage when being at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nGuiding Light\nSource of Light​ cantrip for Callous Glow Ring.\n\n\n-\nRings from the previous act."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThe best staff for caster in Act 1 as it gives bonus Spell Save DC, improving spell success.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nIf this is free, you could use it to get some bonuses from The Protecty Sparkswall armor.\n\n\nTorch\nDo you think I am joking? Fortunately, no. With Shillelagh​ spell this becomes one of the strongest early-game weapons able to surpass in damage all two-handed weapons. You can even dual-wield these.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is a great way to get some bonus damage, especially if you cannot reach the target.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe only truly relevant headwear for Act 1. There are other options but they are just side bonuses.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best caster armor in Act 1.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armor, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nBracers of Defence\nThe +2 Armour class is a big boost especially if you do not have shield proficiencies.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nTo be fair these gloves can be a decent option if they are free. You will get a bonus Armour Class from increased Dexterity.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves can be useful when using spells like Ice Knife​ and later Ice Storm. Although this is not a dedicated Cold build the Encrusted with Frost effect is very useful for weakening enemies and getting them prone.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots, although I would leave them for frontline character if their slots are free. Can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nI would say there is a niche use of this early in the game when you can cast Healing Word​ with bonus action to buff your allies."
      ],
      "2": [
        "For Act 2, you will be dropping that heavy armor for some great medium ones. Some of the items will still be the best ones even if they are from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\n-\nuse the ones from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nThe best caster headwear in Act 2.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nAlthough this works only once per turn, it works well with spells that target Dexterity like Sleet Storm.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\n \nFleshmelter Cloak\nDeal additional damage to the attackers.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you need a higher Armour Class and The Protecty Sparkswall is taken, this is a perfect alternative.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nYou can wear this if The Protecty Sparkswall is taken.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nSpecifically, for the Moon Druid build, Act 2, does not bring many options. So reuse gloves from Act 1.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class in your normal form.\n\n\nAmulet\nStrange Tendril Amulet\nI like Evard's Black Tentacles​ spell, as it is a very strong crowd-control option. You can use the spell before using Wild Shape.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn. Sadly this will not work with Wild Shape.\n\n\nRings\nEversight Ring\nIf you have a Darkness​ party, or members who use this spell, being able to see inside, can make you extremely sturdy.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring, that you can activate its effects with your control spells.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nImproves Armour class while obscured, also works in Wild Shape. For this to activate you need to enter the form in a shadowy area."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMarkoheshkir\nThe most powerful stave in the game. If it is free, feel free to use it and activate relevant Kereska's Favour based on the spells you use. My favorite picks are Frost of Dark Winter and Bolts of Doom.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nVery powerful stave that also gives access to Arcane Battery, giving a free (including level 6) spell cast.\n\n\nStaff of Cherished Necromancy\nThe staff can be used to cast Necromancy spells for free. One of them is Blight.\n\n\nWoe\nGives additional effects like healing.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nThe best caster headwear, that gives +2 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nThe helmet can be used to be able to see in Darkness​ if your group utilizes this spell.\n\n\nShapeshifter Hat\nMentioning this as a goodwill. To be fair, I find the additional charge not as important, especially when long resting in Act 3 is easy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nThe best cloak in the game for casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Moonbasking\nThis armor is specifically made for Moon Druids, as it gives a solid stat boost for Wild Shape​ forms.\n\n\nMutilated Carapace\nOffensive option for shapeshifting Moon Druid. The only downside is that Defence​ from FIghter will not work with it, in that case just take Sorcerer multiclass.\n\n\nArmour of Landfall\nOne of the best caster items in general, as it gives Constitution Saving Throw an advantage, resulting in less spell cancelation.  Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nGives bonus Armour Class and improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives bonuses to Spell Save DC, which will increase spell success chance.\n\n\nQuickspell Gloves\nAllows casting spells with bonus action once per short rest.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Striding\nI think these are the best shoes for Moon Druid, as their effect persists in Wild Shape.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nYou can avoid failing a saving throw, which might break your concentration using a reaction.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nGives bonus armor class and increased saving throw rolls.\n\n\nAmulet\nCorvid Token\nImproves jumping distance of Wild Shape​ and also gains Feather Fall​ condition.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nAlthough this is the best amulet of the caster, I would not prioritize it on Moon Druid, especially as most of the time you will be relying on Beast forms, which don't benefit from this.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt allows restoring spell slots easily.\n\n\nRings\n-\nTo be fair as there are limited rings that work in Wild Shape, and those that work are meh, I would not worry too much about ring slots.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nUse the ring you have for a party that utilizes the Darkness​ effect.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nStill a good ring from Act 1, that will work with some of your spells.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nImproves Armour class while obscured, also works in Wild Shape. For this to activate you need to enter the form in a shadowy area."

        "The early game can be hard, as you do not know where to find items. You also should make a decision, about what kind of setup you are going with - Two-Handed or One-Handed. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThe best one-handed weapon option in Acts 1 and 2. Gives +3 Enchantment and very powerful Sunbeam action.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe only one-handed weapon that improves the critical chance this early in the game. However, I would say it is not the best for a champion as being a shortsword it only does 1d6 damage compared to other options.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nThis weapon is also a contender for best one-handed weapon in Act 1, as it has a unique Razor Gale effect, allowing it to hit multiple targets.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nA perfect one-handed option. Its special Shriek ability will also give a huge boost to other party members. However, I would better use this with Cleric as the activation costs an action and the result is two lost attacks.\n\n\nSword of Screams\nA solid weapon, that gives a bonus 1d4 psychic damage each hit.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA very good choice, has +1 Enchantment but most importantly it can use a spell that gives +2 Armour Class. Fighters don't use the Concentration slot for anything else, so the Tyr's Protection is the perfect choice.\n\n\nEverburn Blade\nThis sword is worth it until you reach Druid's Grove, there it is much better to buy items with +1 Enchantment like Greataxe +1 or Greatsword +1 as they give a better chance of landing attacks and minimal damage decrease.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best option in terms of damage. However, I would not rely heavily on this as you are the most powerful while using Melee weapons.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have use for Bonus Action. However, for dedicated ranged weapons check the options above. And it becomes useless once you get Great Weapon Master.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nGrymskull Helm\nGives resistance to critical hits and allows the use of Hunter's Mark, for additional single-target damage.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nGreat helmet, that can deal bonus damage to attacking targets. Be sure to have a high Armour Class to avoid enemy hits\n\n\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, by providing once-per-turn invisibility.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nVery powerful armor in Act 1, that is perfect for frontliner and if you have 12 Dexterity or lower.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nAnother powerful armour from Grymforge, that is best worn with 14 Dexterity, to get Bonus Armour Class, making it equal to Heavy Armour.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Very solid option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nThese gloves set your Dexterity to 18, allowing you to respec and dump it to 8. You can then maximize Constitution and other abilities like Wisdom, and Charisma to work better against spells. However, once you obtain Great Weapon Master: All In​ and do not have Risky Ring yet, take the option below\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nTruly the best option in Act 1, as this will guarantee that your attacks land.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nGives additional protection against being Prone.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThis is a very powerful amulet, that will lead you through most of the game, the 1d6 bonus damage is very good.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nProvides 2 damage increase on each weapon hit, making it a good choice in Act 1. It is very expensive.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nBonus thunder damage to thunder spells."

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. You also can get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. Overall, you will get improvements to gear as you progress naturally. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThis still plays a major role in Act 2, even more so as its light effect helps with combat in the Darkness.\n\n\nMyrkulite Scourge\nDeals bonus necrotic damage. Otherwise, it is a normal choice.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nMoonlight Glaive\nHas a passive light effect, making it effective with Callous Glow Ring. Moreover, it gets bonus radiant damage and unique attack actions.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nA good choice for Act 2 and can be used till Act 3. Besides its unique benefits, it comes with bonus 1d4 force damage and not many enemies can resist it.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nThe best option in terms of damage. However, I would not rely heavily on this as you are the most powerful while using Melee weapons.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nThe shield provides a bonus initiative that is good for starting the turns earlier.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nThe shield is still relevant especially as it gives resistance to Critical hits.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nIt increases the critical chance by 5%, and it only requires you to be obscured. Moreover, gives some resistance against spells by providing bonus Saving Throws.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nProvides bonus critical chance while obscured. The first helmet in the game that will offer this bonus.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nReflect 1d4 acid damage if somebody hits you in melee range.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThis armor is strange and very useful for the build. With it, you are not limited to a +2 Armour Class bonus from Dexterity. So while using it, I recommend respeccing, so that you would have 16 Dexterity. You can lower Constitution to 14 for this if you do not use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. Another benefit is its initiative bonus, allowing you to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe armor is still potent in Act 2, but be on the lookout for others with 19 Armour Class like Splint Armour +2.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nStill plays a good role in Act 2, as its 16 Armour Class is plenty.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Automaton\nSimilar to the option below, these provide an Advantage on attacks but require Bonus Action to activate the effect.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves are mandatory at least until you get Risky Ring or if you do not use Great Weapon Master feat yet.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus fire damage, however, only use it once you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nA solid option as it gives a bonus 1d4 necrotic damage. But only use it after you get Risky Ring.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nNot a perfect amulet, but could be useful once you have Risky Ring and at least Covert Cowl. This would then allow for easy paralysis on some enemies.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nStill, the best amulet as it provides a substantial damage boost if healed - a cleric can do this easily.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAlternative to the amulet above if taken by another member. Gives bonus survivability and allows casting Shield with reaction.\n\n\nRings\nKiller's Sweetheart\nAllows dealing guaranteed critical hit per long rest. After this, you can just unequip it. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nEasily get bonus damage if creatures are illuminated, this can be done by casting Light on yourself by an ally.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial.\n\n\nRing of Free Action\nMakes you immune to difficult terrain, and you cannot be paralyzed otherwise.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nMakes you immune to being blinded, which can be detrimental in some encounters."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Act 3 gives so many different items, that the build can be changed multiple times as you explore it. For example, you could go with Nyrulna + Bhaalist Armour for very strong damage, but sacrificing armour class. On the other hand, you can pick Balduran's Giantslayer and take armor like Helldusk Armour or Armour of Persistence to play a more survivability role. So definitely try out different combinations to find the sweet spot for your playstyle. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nNyrulna(BiS)\nAlthough this would technically be a weapon used for Throwing builds, it is perfect as a melee choice. You can still throw it for AOE lightning damage as Extra Attack​ still works. It is also ridiculously powerful if you equip Bhaalist Armour for constant vulnerability.\n\n\nBelm\nWhat makes this one special is that it has a unique Whirlwind attack, that can target all nearby enemies with separate attack rolls. You can easily do three smites on different targets with it. It has another effect when worn in an offhand, you can use it as a bonus action attack which replicates the main hand weapon.\n\n\nDuellist's Prerogative\nAlthough the weapon is aimed at single-wielding without a shield, it is still useful as it allows additional attack using bonus action. However, if you want the bonus to critical chance you will have to forgo shield. But that should not be a problem if you have Duelling​ passive\n\n\nDevotee's Mace\nDeals 1d8 bonus radiant damage and has +3 enchantment to damage and attack rolls.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nBalduran's Giantslayer(BiS)\nThe best two-handed sword in the game. Gives huge damage bonuses from high strength and is a perfect large monster killer.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\nA good choice, specifically for Githyanki due to bonus damage and resistance. Otherwise, it falls short of other options.\n\n\nNyrulna\nThis weapon can also be used as two-handed, albeit its base damage is not as high. It can be a perfect choice until you obtain the top ones. It is also ridiculously powerful if you equip Bhaalist Armour for constant vulnerability.\n\n\nHellbeard Halberd\nThis gives a bonus of 6 poison damage per hit, which is very high, making it a strong top weapon contender.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow for crit fishing builds as it increases the critical chance.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress(BiS)\nThe strongest shield in the game. Has a special shield bash reaction that deals force damage. Moreover, gives good resistance to spells.\n\n\nSwires' Sledboard\nProvides Force Conduit each turn, decreasing the damage that the wielder receives.\n\n\nHead\nSarevok's Horned Helmet(BiS)\nThe only helmet in Act 3 that provides a bonus critical chance.\n\n\nMask of Soul Perception\nThe best helmet to increase attack chance success when using Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nIncreases attack rolls and provides a bit more damage with weapons. just be sure to not have your HP at maximum, make an ally hit you before the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nHelldusk Armour(BiS)\nThis armor has the highest armor class in the game. Moreover, it grants flying and burns enemies in flames when they attack you.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nA solid defensive choice, that comes with damage reduction cantrip effects.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe armor does not limit the Dexterity bonus to AC. So you can again make sure via respec that it is 16, to get +3 to AC.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nThis is light armor, so you should be maximizing your Dexterity and have it at least at 16, to get a high Armour Class. Together with Nyrulna you can deal frightening amounts of damage due to the Aura Of Murder​ effect.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves(BiS)\nGives a solid bonus of 1d6 fire damage on hit, and provides a fire spell with Strength as a casting ability!\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\n+ 2 bonuses to damage and attack rolls. Which is perfect when using Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nAllows avaoiding failed Saving Throws, and uses reaction to change the outcome. Moreover, provides bonus actions for mobility and damage.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives a huge boost to mobility and avoids difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nStill a good choice if you find it useful.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nThe amulet still pulls strong even in the late game.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nMakes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. However, this means that you also sacrifice an amulet slot for something that could be more offensive.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring(BiS)\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart(BiS)\nGuarantees a critical hit once per Long rest. Moreover, it can change an attack that misses and turns it into critical.\n\n\nCaustic Band\n2 Acid damage on any kind of attack. With multiple attacks you do the bonus is substantial. Can be equipped after Killer's Sweetheart has been used"

This staff should also support you in Act 2.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nGives +1 to spell attack rolls or DC. An alternative to The Spellsparkler in case it is used by someone else.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe higher initiative bonus will allow you to start your turn earlier.\n\n\nHunting Shortbow\nA good option as it gives Advantage with Attack Rolls on multiple enemies in Act 1 - Bulette, Hook Horror, Gnolls, etc.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquipping two of these will allow you to attack with off-hand. This is important as you may not have used for bonus action if your Sorcery points have been expended, so this will allow some bonus damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nIncreases Spell Save Difficulty Counter, while obscured.

Without it, the item loses its purpose.\n\n\nCloak\nAny\nAnything will work as Act 1 does not have any good options.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nWorks well with The Spellsparkler for additional bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws with Lightning Charges. The best choice in Act 1.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nApplies Reverbation when dealing thunder or lightning damage. With 5 stacks, this will deal a bonus 1d4 damage and can make enemies Prone. This can be easily achieved once you have The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\nGives bonus spell attack rolls, making Scorching Ray and later Eldritch Blast succeed better.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nGives whooping +2 Armour Class. This is the perfect option especially if you do not have shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves that allow to negate enemy ranged attack.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nAllows to easily avoid opportunity attacks and keep distance from enemies iwth it's special action.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nA good amulet that allows restoring level 3 or lower spell slots.

        "This is the mid-game, where most of the areas will be covered by dark. Radiant equipment will shine here and having Darkvision​ is recommended. We also can get some great items, albeit some will stay the same from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee\nMelf's First Staff\nThese items are still relevant in Act 2 and provide very good bonuses.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nThis bow allows casting Haste without using a spell slot. However, if you do not care about that, continue using the items from Act 1.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe only shield that improves the Spell Difficulty class and attack rolls.\n\n\nShield of Devotion\nThe extra level 1 spell slot can be used for Sorcery Points.\n\n\nHead\nCovert Cowl\nAs you can easily become obscured it is an easy way to obtain increased critical chance.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nUse this Cloak if you will still be using Reverbation items like Gloves of Belligerent Skies\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe\nOne of the main items that makes the build as powerful as it is. This requires to make some specific decisions during Act 1. However, the boost to Eldritch Blast damage is worth it.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nYou can continue using the same items from Act 1.\n\n\nDaredevil Gloves\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots will be more and more powerful as you release more Eldritch Blast rays to stack Reverbation with Spineshudder Amulet.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives armor class an increase. Best choice if you are not using Shield\n\n\nBoots of Arcane Bolstering \nThese boots can be a great way to increase damage. However, I found the mechanic a bit too tedious to be used effectively.\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet\nYou can use this amulet to get more bonuses for Reverbation activation.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nWhen creatures are illuminated you deal bonus damage to them, this should not be hard, as your cleric will probably be carrying something like Blood of Lathander to illuminate them. Or you could stand closer to enemies and have a Light spell on yourself.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nIt is fairly easy to cast any light spell on yourself or have an ally do that. The Radiating Orb effect will debuff enemies, making it harder for them to hit targets.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nBecause it is easy to be obscured this allows to gain bonus armour class. Very useful in Act 2."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. I recommend Dual-wielding the suggested weapons as their bonuses stack, enabling the highest possible critical rate. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe strongest caster weapon in the game. You can use Kereska's Favour​ and activate Bolts of Doom​. This will greatly improve the number of Lightning Charges​ that you generate with each hit. If you would like to wear it with other weapons you will need Dual Wielder​ feat.\n\n\nRhapsody(BiS)\nThe unique effect that gives +1 damage for each Scarlet Remittance​ stack. This requires you to kill enemies (previously you could destroy barrels), but this should be easy in late game where normal grunts will be dead from your blasts in a few hits.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThe weapon offers a 1d4 Thunder damage rider via its special action - Phalar Aluve: Shriek. It can be worn by you or another companion like Cleric.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nThe weapon offers increased critical chance and provides bonus armour class. Excellent choice both for offense and defense.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA great choice for this build as it improves critical chance and provides other bonuses.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nThe best bow for crit fishing builds as it increases the critical chance.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThis is still the top contender for the build if you will opt out for a shield.\n\n\nHead\nSarevok's Horned Helmet\nTo maximize the critical chance, this helm is a very good option. Moreover, it gives additional bonuses like +1 to Constitution Saving Throw.\n\n\nBirthright\nProvides +2 Charisma, allowing to maximize the bonus damage to each Eldritch Blast beam.\n\n\nHelmet of Grit(BiS)\nYou can now release another Eldritch Blast with Metamagic: Quickened Spell​ as you gain one more Bonus Action. You can either sacrifice HP or let allies hit you. However, this will decrease your survivability.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave(BiS)\nThis is the best cloak for this build as it gives a direct boost to attack rolls. The result is more successful spells.\n\n\nShade-Slayer Cloak\nThis item increases the critical chance, but it only activates while hiding, which can be difficult to achieve mid-combat.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nPotent Robe(BiS)\nThis continues to be the best robe in the game for Eldritch Blast build.\n\n\nGloves\nCraterflesh Gloves(BiS)\nThese gloves are ridiculously bugged making you release a second Blast if the the beam crits. So if all three crit, this will result in 6 beams. Crazy right? I am assuming this will be patched someday, but for now, they are very powerful.\n\n\nSpellmight Gloves\nAmazing gloves, that work with spells that use attack rolls. If they are taken by other characters, use the ones from previous acts. However, they will lower attack rolls, so be sure to have Risky Ring or other alternatives that improve success chances.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour(BiS)\nThe boots become even more powerful as your critical chance increases and you can apply Freighten more easily from Mortal Reminder.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nOptimal choice if you are wearing a robe and go all in on the dual-wielding, this way you get bonus armor class.\n\n\nAmulet\nSpineshudder Amulet(BiS)\nYou can use this amulet to get more bonuses for Reverbation activation.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nAllows to paralyze an enemy when landing a critical hit once per Long Rest\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring(BiS)\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring(BiS)\nDeals bonus 2 damage against illuminated enemies. Although it is not much, this also works with spells. Just be sure to cast Light on yourself."

This cantrip is special in the sense, that it can get multiple sources of damage boosts but also has Repelling Blast invocation that allows you to knock back enemies.

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nThese weapons are go-to picks if you want other options, especially for more damage. You either need high strength or Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to utilise the weapons effectively.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\n\n\nSword of Justice\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nAn excellent weapon that can be used with both dexterity and strength. It also comes with Phalar Aluve: Melody​ to apply buffs/debuffs depending on what you need in a combat situation.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nSimilar to Phalar Aluve, it can be used effectively with high Dexterity or Strength and comes with a unique area attack.\n\n\n+1 Weapon\nPurchase any +1 weapon in Druid's Grove like Greataxe +1, Greatsword +1, etc.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear for pure weapon damage increase.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nGives immunity to critical hits.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe best Act 1 heavy armor, with critical immunity and damage reduction.\n\n\nChain Mail +1\nEarly armour, once you get a few levels up, comes with 17 Armour Class.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThis can be equipped when starting the game by taking it from Lae'zel. Perfect option with a high Armour Class.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nOne of the best picks for Natural Strength setup. This allows for maintaining high investment in Strength, Charisma, and Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies the Baneful Strike​ effect, which weakens foe saving throws, making them perfect targets for control actions or spells. This can make many bosses easier, as you can now land spells with a higher chance. For example, you can use this to make Control Undead​ or Command​ easier to land.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nIt can be used together with Divine Smite​ to weaken enemies.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source for the main damage types.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe best ring for now in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1."

This will reward you with one of these. The Shar's Spear of Evening is considerably stronger in Act 3, when also using Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with +2 enchantment and comes with a Force damage rider.\n\n\n-\nPrevious Act weapons still play a decent role, and can be used effectively.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nIt's not better than Diadem of Arcane Synergy, but if you have Booming Blade,​ you could use Ring of Arcane Synergy instead. This means you can get some nice undead in Act 2 with a higher chance when casting Control Undead.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDwarven Splintmail\nA semi-upgrade to Adamantine Splint Armour with a boost to Constitution and AC, but lower damage reduction.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nSolid gloves for weapon damage boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nYou will want to wear these gloves if you are using the Natural Strength setup, to invest dexterity points into Constitution.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nBoth of these gloves are a decent option, the higher ones give additional action to curse creatures in at least Lightly Obscured​ areas.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives a psychic damage rider, which is easy to activate by using one of the Concentration spells.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nIf you have a hard time getting Advantage on your attacks, this is the easiest fix, although it comes with a disadvantage on mental saves.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nCan be used for a single encounter, to get a guaranteed critical hit. After that, you can switch it with other rings."

        "Here, the main setup change is that you will use Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength and switch them up with Strength Elixirs. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening(BiS)\nThese are the best weapons in terms of damage, but require you to have Bhaalist Armour for Aura Of Murder​ effect. I do prefer Nyrulna as it comes with neat weapon actions, which are usable and good.\n\n\nNyrulna\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThese are the two-hander options, without Aura Of Murder​. They are both decent weapon options, but are inferior to piercing ones, when it's easy to apply vulnerability.\n\n\nSilver Sword of the Astral Plane\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nEasy initiative source, to go early.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIn terms of pure damage, this is the best option as it enables you to activate Arcane Synergy​ to utilize your high charisma for damage.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nA flat damage boost on melee attacks.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is one of the options, in case the headwear is free. You can use it together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to disable foes using the Command​ spell. It is also useful for Control Undead.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIn terms of utility, this is one of the best headwear - critical immunity, Stunned​ immunity, and each round healing.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nOne of the best defensive cloaks, improving your chances of avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis is the best pick in terms of combat potential. It doesn't mean that you have to wear it, but at least one frontline member should have it. It will double piercing damage via Aura Of Murder, this is why Shar's Spear of Evening or Nyrulna are one of the best picks.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\nBoth of these are great armours. I would probably prioritize Armour of Persistence for its Blade Ward​ effect.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength(BiS)\nSets the Strength to 23, allowing you to stop using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and opening the elixir slot for better ones like Elixir of Bloodlust.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nGives a good damage and attack roll boost.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe simplest option for Natural Strength setup.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nThese are the best boots to take for any kind of build to avoid any of the various surface effects.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives increased damage as long as you drink a potion or get a healing source.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nNot that high of a priority here, especially when not using items like Helmet of Grit. But still, one of the options if it's available.\n\n\n-\nAmulets from the previous Acts.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nPretty easy to get the bonus damage boost while enemies are at least Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs the build has plenty of concentration spells, the psychic damage rider is easy to obtain and can be even doubled if any of the party members use Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThis ring can only be used if you have Booming Blade. It is an alternative to Diadem of Arcane Synergy, which allows using different headwear, albeit at the cost of damage rings.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThe ring allows casting spells with bonus action and can be used with Helmet of Arcane Acuity to boost your Spell success chance. Of course, you can also use it to cast Plant Growth​ to greatly empower your spellsword capabilities.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring continues to be an option, but I think there are better items to use in this slot, especially as the build starts to become very powerful without Bless​ buff.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA solid ring that boosts armour class.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nA one-time ring that you can use to land a critical hit with Divine Smite​ and unequip it until the next long rest.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nStill an option, but I would avoid it, as getting Advantage should not be a problem by this time in the game."

        "For the game to begin, you will want to obtain The Spellsparkler, as it will give a big boost to Magic Missile​ damage. This can be done easily at level 3. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nThe Spellsparkler\nThis is the best stave that you can use, will activate Lightning Charges​ on each Magic Missile​ projectile.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nEither have someone else equip this weapon or use Dual Wielder​ to wield it. With Phalar Aluve: Shriek,​ each of the missiles will deal an additional 1d4 thunder damage.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nAnother weapon option that you should use Dual Wielder​ with The Spellsparkler. This will improve your Spell Save DC, making it easy to land other spells besides Magic Missile.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is an amazing weapon as you can use bonus action to break water bottles to apply wet.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe best headwear in Act 1. Just be sure to be at least Lightly Obscured​ if you can.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nBest clothing for caster in Act 1, will synergize well with The Spellsparkler.\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nMake sure to get this armor as later it can be synergized with one ring, for Radiating Orb​ spam.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThese gloves work very well with Lightning Charges​ from The Spellsparkler. Later on, you will get another ring that will give even more Reverberation​ stacks.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nDecent early-game gloves that give good armor class, in case you do not have Shield proficiency.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese are not the best boots, but they are good, especially if you use other spells that apply conditions besides Magic Missile.\n\n\nThe Watersparkers\nVery effective boots that allow you to have 3 Lightning Charges​, before you initiate combat. Just drop Water, use Off-Hand Attack (Ranged)​ to break it. It will electrify water and you can deal more damage from the get-go.\n\n\nAmulet\nPsychic Spark\nThe best amulet for Magic Missile Build until Act 3. It gives additional missiles, and you can cast a level 1 spell, to save some slots for each long rest.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nRestore up to a level 3 spell slot. Can be unequipped after use.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Absolute Force\nThis ring works very well with Reverberation​ as it will improve its Thunder damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\n-\nUse weapons from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nNe'er Misser\nThis crossbow will give you a free cast of Level 3 Magic Missile. If you equip it be sure to use it with Hand Crossbow +1 in the offhand.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield there is for a caster.\n\n\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nImproves spell success chance and increases the likelihood of going first.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverbation, this cloak is amazing and allows Dazing enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nStill continues to be one of the best choices\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nIn Act 2, you can obtain Callous Glow Ring. Wearing it enables to activation of Radiating Shockwave​ and the application of multiple Radiating Orb. To be fair, this is not mandatory, especially if you have cleric in the party as they are better suited for this armor.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nAnother robe that gives +1 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nIn Act 2, these will also work extremely well with Callous Glow Ring.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nCan apply Reverberation​ with spells, causing conditions.\n\n\nBoots of Arcane Bolstering\nThese boots can give a huge damage boost. However, this will require some preparation and getting close to enemies to receive Threatened​ status. Check the combat section below for how to utilize it. If you want to avoid complicated setups, take other boots.\n\n\nAmulet\nPsychic Spark\nStill, the best amulet to use for optimal Magic Missile​ damage.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nAmazing ring, that works well with this build. You will get bonus Reverbation stacks while wearing Gloves of Belligerent Skies. Moreover, be sure to cast illumination spells like Light​ or Daylight​ on yourself or your enemies so that they will be illuminated. Or have someone with an illuminated weapon close.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nThis ring will be even more powerful as you can apply Reverberation​ stacks faster with the Callous Glow Ring.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nInflict Radiating Orb​ with spell damage.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nAs you will still cast spells, enemies that fail against them will incur Mental Fatigue.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nApplies Dazed​ on creatures with Reverberation​."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible, you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Now, for the other equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nMarkoheshkir(BiS)\nThe best caster staff in the game (well, almost the best). This fits the build extremely well and you can use Kereska's Favour​ to activate Bolts of Doom​. This enables you to generate Lightning Charges​ so you can take off The Spellsparkler. Moreover, you gain access to Chain Lightning​ and Lightning Bolt​ each short rest.\n\n\nRhapsody\nThe second-best weapon for Magic Missile build. It requires you to kill 3 enemies (this can be done by taking out some guards) which buffs up each Missile with a flat 3 damage bonus. Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC for other spells.\n\n\n-\nWeapons from previous acts\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow(BiS)\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first.\n\n\nHead\nHat of the Sharp Caster\nIf you want to maximize the damage of Magic Missile,​ this hat helps to reroll damage dice.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nThe hood gives solid +2 Spell Save DC, greatly improving spell success chance.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImprove Spell Save DC by one, the best option for a direct increase in build effectiveness.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until they get hit for that turn.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs you will be constantly applying Reverberation, this cloak is amazing and applies Dazed​ to enemies who dare to attack you.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nI would say Luminous Armour is the best pick in terms of the Radiating Orb​ debuffs. However, as it is better suited for a Cleric in my opinion, the other armor options are just as good. I would rank Armour of Landfall above the Robe of the Weave due to the Advantage on Constitution saving throws.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\n\n\nLuminous Armour\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nUse this to stack Reverberation​ from lightning, thunder, and radiant damage.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nAnother option in Act 3, also gives a level 3 Command​ spell for each Long Rest. The gloves provide +1 Spell Save DC,\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Arcane Bolstering\nStill the best boots, if you are not lazy about doing all the setups.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nCan apply Reverberation​ with spells, causing conditions.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Elemental Torment(BiS)\nAlthough this would be best in a slot amulet, it can be irritating to activate. You will need Fire surfaces to utilize the bonus damage.\n\n\nPsychic Spark\nI would say still a relevant amulet, even in Act 3.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe +2 Spell Save DC is a huge boost, giving a large success improvement for spells.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nRestores up to level 6 spell slots. After using it, you can unequip it for another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring still stands on top for improved damage and applying Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nRing of Absolute Force\nImproves burst damage from Reverberation​ stacks by 1.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nIf you are more keen on debuffing enemy attack rolls, use this one."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nDefender Flail\nWith its Steel Physiology​ effect, it reduces incoming damage while you use Warding Bond.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nExcellent item, for the earlier part of Act 1. The main highlight is its Phalar Aluve: Melody​ for beneficial buffs on attack and defense.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nExcellent shield, which proves valuable with the Reeling​ debuff.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGreat initial shield, with bonuses to Saving Throws.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nBoth of these helmets work well. My preference is the Holy Lance Helm as you will already have plenty of healing items. Still, to maximize the latter, feel free to use Wapira's Crown.\n\n\nWapira's Crown\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nGives a significant damage reduction, which will improve the survivability as you soak damage.\n\n\nGloves\nHellrider's Pride\nThe best gloves for support, as they give Blade Ward​ to allies that you heal. They do not apply to you, so you will still need to cast Blade Ward.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nHelps reduce damage from ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Striding\nBoth of these boots are excellent options as they will help you maintain spell Concentration, which can easily be broken if you fall.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\nBoots of Aid and Comfort\nThese boots are perfect for maximizing survivability, as they give health-related bonuses.\n\n\nVital Conduit Boots\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best amulet for a support build with additional healing spells.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nOne of the best support items. By using Preserve Life, Mass Healing Word,​ you can heal and buff allies with Bless,​ improving their combat capabilities.\n\n\nRing of Salving\nA slight boost to the healing amount is useful in the early game, but as the HP pool increases, its usefulness becomes negligible. Revorb Setup Act 1 provides the core items, which don't change much throughout the game. There will be a few additions in Act 2, but that's it. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThe best weapon for Revorb setup, as it applies a condition that triggers Boots of Stormy Clamour.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThe main highlight is Phalar Aluve: Melody,​ which can buff allies or debuff enemies, depending on which effect you pick.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nGives a Reeling​ debuff on enemies that miss you.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nDeals radiant damage to attackers that miss, and also activates Reverberation​ from other items.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for applying Radiating Orb​ en masse with Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best items for applying Reverberation, via various damage types.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nApplies Reverberation​ via conditions, which is easy to achieve with Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nBetter movement speed, allowing you to hit more enemies with Spirit Guardians."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nAct 1, items are still the best uses.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nIf you want to cast Haste​ with a cleric on an ally, this bow is excellent for that.\n\n\nShield\nSentinel Shield\nIf you are dedicated to go first, this shield will make sure you do that in most encounters.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nAlthough this is technically better for caster than Adamantine Shield, still, I think the Act 1 shield is better. \n\n\n-\nShields from previous acts.\n\n\nHead\nFlawed Helldusk Helmet\nGives sizeable bonuses to saving throws, helping to keep spell concentration\n\n\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nA good helmet with bonuses that help to maintain spell concentration.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nThis is a decent helmet option if you want higher spell success. But I would still prefer the previous act's headwear, as I think their effects are nicer for the setup this build is doing.\n\n\n-\nHelmets from the previous Act.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nNot much difference in which cloak you choose to equip. However, I would use Cloak of Protection on the party member who has the lowest Armour Class. For others, they do give relevant benefits.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\n\n\nArmor\nReaper's Embrace\nGreat armor with flat damage reduction and other useful features.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nI would say this is still a solid choice with a flat damage decrease.\n\n\nRippling Force Mail\nGives Force Conduit​ effect, which is great for reducing damage. Still, the main problem is that you first need to be hit.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nIf you were not able to obtain Adamantine Splint Armour, this is the best option for now.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nUse the ones from the previous Act.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nUse the ones from the previous Act.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nContinues to be the best support amulet in my eyes.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAnother option with a single Shield​ use.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nYou can instantly stand up in case the character gets Downed​.\n\n\nRings\n-\nTo be fair no major items here that could give a big improvement. Ring of Free Action might be useful, but only in a handful of situations. Revorb Setup There are a few key additions to the items for this setup, which will give a good improvement: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nGloves\nLuminous Gloves\nThis is an optional glove option, if you want more Radiating Orb​, however, I still would prioritize Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nGives additional radiant damage, which is easy to proc.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nTheoretically, it should work better than listed. Unfortunately, it works only on single-time damage, like Sacred Flame. It does not work with Spirit Guardians, so I give this ring lower priority."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nFor weapons, nothing much really changes. You should still use either Phalar Aluve or Defender Flail.\n\n\nRanged\nGontr Mael\nBoth of these bows work well. Hellrider Longbow, is especially good, but it can be in high demand, while Gontr Mael gives an easy source of Haste,​ which you can use on spell Concentration.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nThe strongest shield in the game, which gives you Warding Bond,​ allowing you to save a spell slot. Still, it has other uses, like good bonuses and actions.\n\n\nSwires' Sledboard\nGives Force Conduit​ on each turn, reducing damage taken from physical sources.\n\n\nHead\nHelm of Balduran\nHands down the best headwear for this setup. Constant healing will proc Blade Ward​ from The Reviving Hands. It also gives crit immunity.\n\n\nCloak\nMantle of the Holy Warrior\nCan be used to buff allies for bonus damage with Crusader's Mantle.\n\n\nArmor\nHelldusk Armour\nExcellent armour with a flat -3 damage to all sources. This greatly improves the damage that you can sustain from Warding Bond.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nArmour alternative, which also reduces all incoming damage. Also, gives Blade Ward​\n\n\nGloves\nThe Reviving Hands\nSimilar to Hellrider's Pride, these also apply buffs to yourself.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nThese boots help you avoid falling down on Ice or other slippery surfaces\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nThe best amulet for clerics, giving an additional cast of Preserve Life.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIf you want maximum survivability with a Life Cleric build, this amulet will give a huge health boost. Moreover, it will maximize your constitution saving throws.\n\n\nKhalid's Gift\nCan be used to play around with higher Wisdom values, which would allow taking another feat.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nExcellent amulet to improve success against spells.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThis continues to be the best ring in terms of buffs for the game.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nHealing item that can be an alternative to Helm of Balduran, to activate buffs.\n\n\nTill Death Do Us Part\nCan be used to cast Beacon of Hope​ and save a spell slot. Revorb Setup So in Act 3, nothing changes for Revorb setup to be honest. So you can continue using items from previous Acts."

The build goes all in for the Heavy Armor, Warding Bond setup, enabling you to soak up damage from your allies.

        "The game beginning will be interesting. First, you will need to obtain some kind of Heavy Armor, to have a decent Armour Class with only 10 Dexterity. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nI like using this sword, as it has its unique action Phalar Aluve: Shriek. What makes it special is that you will have two beast companions there would be an additional 2d8 damage every turn.\n\n\nUnseen Menace\nSolid choice as it increases the critical chance and provides an advantage on attack rolls.\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the best greatswords that you can get in Act 1. The bonus to attack rolls is great for counteracting Great Weapon Master: All In​ effect.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA solid greatsword, that gives bonus armour class with Shield of Faith​ action.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is an amazing weapon as you can use bonus action to break water bottles to apply wet.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is the best helmet in terms of damage improvements. It activates off Threatened status.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nI think the melee aspect of the build greatly benefits from this helmet, so I recommend it.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nThe best heavy armor in Act 1. Gives good Armour class, and enemies cannot critically hit you.\n\n\nChain Mail +1\nBecomes available at about level 4 in trader inventories. It has 17 Armour Class.\n\n\nChain Mail\nAlthough it is a common rarity, 16 Armour Class early in the game will be a solid option.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nThe best gloves for this build. With them equipped, you can decrease Dexterity to 8 via respec and put those points into any other ability.\n\n\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nVery strong gloves as they give Advantage. It is the best way to counteract the Great Weapon Master: All In​ -5 attack roll effect.\n\n\nBracers of Defence\nThese are the best early-game gloves, giving you a +2 Armour class if you are not using a shield.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves to reduce the damage of incoming ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nThese boots can allow you to move into key targets without getting hit with Opportunity attacks.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nGood boots that allow moving without slowing down on difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nThis is a good amulet that can double your damage with a cost of bonus action. For example, it would work perfectly against bosses where Great Weapon Master: Bonus Attack​ may not activate every time.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet in the game that gives direct damage increase, can be activated with a single health potion before combat.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nStrange Conduit Ring\nAs you have some concentration spells, this ring can be easily activated for a little bonus damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nA solid ring with a +2 acid damage bonus on your weapon attacks.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nA good movement boost makes it easier to reach those targets."

        "For Act 2, you will be dropping that heavy armor for some great medium ones. Some of the items will still be the best ones even if they are from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nThis is a very strong weapon, you can start using it now, or wait till level 11 and unlock the improved Raven companion. After that, this will be an extremely powerful weapon.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nA strong weapon that has unique actions - Moonbeam​ hits targets in small areas and Moonmote, buffs allies, particularly your beasts.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThe sword is still a solid two-handed weapon choice through most of Act 2.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, although it may be a bug.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is the best helmet in terms of damage improvements. It activates off Threatened status. \n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nMedium armor that will reach 19 Armour class together with Gloves of Dexterity. Moreover, the bonus initiative is a great boon.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nA solid heavy armour, that can take you to Act 3.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Dexterity\nStill the best option to use if you can afford it.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nGives a bonus of 1d4 damage, which is a good boost to melee damage.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still the best ones you can equip.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nRisky Ring\nI would say this is the best Ring, that you can get, to eliminate the effect of Great Weapon Master: All In.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill a good ring to use, for easy +2 damage.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nIf you are using Concentration spells, this would give 0.5 more damage than Caustic Band."

Moreover, it comes with unique weapon actions that can inflict bleeding and knockback foes. This is the best weapon to use if you plan on equipping Bhaalist Armour.\n\n\nBalduran's Giantslayer\nThe strongest greatsword in the game. It gets a big damage boost from your strength modifier.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nIf you plan on utilizing the Darkness effect from Corvus Celer (Raven), this spear is a perfect match. It gives blindness immunity and bonus damage while being obscured.\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot\nImproves critical range for attack rolls.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nI would pick this bow if you are using Heavy Armour.

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThe best staff for caster in Act 1 as it gives bonus Spell Save DC, improving spell success.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nIf this is free, you could use it to get some bonuses from The Protecty Sparkswall armor.\n\n\nTorch\nDo you think I am joking? Fortunately, no. With Shillelagh​ spell this becomes one of the strongest early-game weapons able to surpass in damage all two-handed weapons. You can even dual-wield these.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is a great way to get some bonus damage, especially if you cannot reach the target.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe only truly relevant headwear for Act 1. There are other options but they are just side bonuses.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best caster armor in Act 1.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armor, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nBracers of Defence\nThe +2 Armour class is a big boost especially if you do not have access to a shield.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nTo be fair these gloves can be a decent option if they are free. You will get a bonus Armour Class from increased Dexterity.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves can be useful when using spells like Ice Knife​ and later Ice Storm​. Although this is not a dedicated Cold build the Encrusted with Frost effect is very useful for weakening enemies and getting them prone.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThis is a very powerful item, however, I would only wear it if you do not have another dedicated controller like Cleric or Sorlock.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots, although I would leave them for frontline character if their slots are free. Can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nI like this amulet as it gives another use for bonus action, which can be epxloited by your allies.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nI would say there is a niche use of this early in the game when you can cast Healing Word​ with bonus action to buff your allies."

        "For Act 2, you will be dropping that heavy armor for some great medium ones. Some of the items will still be the best ones even if they are from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\n-\nuse the ones from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nThe best caster headwear in Act 2.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nAlthough this works only once per turn, it works well with spells that target Dexterity like Sleet Storm​.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\n \nFleshmelter Cloak\nDeal additional damage to the attackers.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you need a higher Armour Class and The Protecty Sparkswall is taken, this is a perfect alternative.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nYou can wear this if The Protecty Sparkswall is taken.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nSpecifically, for the Land Druid build, Act 2, does not bring many options. So reuse gloves from Act 1.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still the best ones you can equip.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nI recommend these shoes if you use Wild Shape heavily. This will allow you to walk on the ice surfaces that you can create with Sleet Storm.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nEversight Ring\nIf you have a Darkness​ party, or members who use this spell, being able to see inside, can make you extremely sturdy.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring, that you can activate its effects with your control spells.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nCan help apply additional Radiating Orb​"

If it is free, feel free to use it and activate relevant Kereska's Favour based on the spells you use. My favorite picks are Frost of Dark Winter and Bolts of Doom.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nVery powerful stave that also gives access to Arcane Battery, giving a free (including level 6) spell cast.\n\n\nStaff of Cherished Necromancy\nThe staff can be used to cast Necromancy spells for free. One of them is Blight.\n\n\nWoe\nGives additional effects like healing.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nThe best caster headwear, that gives +2 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nThe helmet can be used to be able to see in Darkness​ if your group utilizes this spell.\n\n\nShapeshifter Hat\nMentioning this as a goodwill. To be fair, I find the additional charge not as important, especially when long resting in Act 3 is easy.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nThe best cloak in the game for casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nOne of the best caster items in general, as it gives Constitution Saving Throw an advantage, resulting in less spell cancelation.  Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nGives bonus Armour Class and improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives bonuses to Spell Save DC, which will increase spell success chance.\n\n\nQuickspell Gloves\nAllows casting spells with bonus action once per short rest.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nYou can avoid failing a saving throw, which might break your concentration using a reaction.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nGives bonus armor class and increased saving throw rolls.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nThis amulet is in high demand, I would recommend it on cleric, if you don't have one, then put it on the Druid.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt allows restoring spell slots easily.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nIt gives a huge bonus against most control spell effects, reducing the chance that their effects would land.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThis ring has a hidden bonus of +1 Spell Save DC. Use it if you don't have any other dedicated casters like Sorcerer.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nThe ring is still an excellent option for applying negative status effects.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nIt can be used if you have the Darkness​ effect party setup and need to see in magical darkness."

        "In Act 1, you should be using Unarmed attacks most time, and pump strength with Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nI recommend picking this weapon up, it can be dual-wielded with Club of Hill Giant Strength, and I would recommend using it together with Stunning Strike (Melee).\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis is an amazing weapon as it sets strength to 19 and improves your damage when using Tavern Brawler​ feat.\n\n\nCorellon's Grace\nA decent early-game monk weapon. You can use it until you obtain Tavern Brawler​ to attack with fists. Otherwise, it can continue to be used until you obtain some of the weapons with better stats.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nHunting Shortbow\nExcellent bow against monstrosities. There are plenty of them in Act 1.\n\n\nHead\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility. Only available to Dark Urge origin.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nGives +2 Dexterity, making it a very good choice for the end of Act 1 and the start of Act 2.\n\n\nArmour of Uninhibited Kushigo\nSomewhat relatable first unarmed build armor. It is nothing special as I do not think you will utilize the effect.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Cinder and Sizzle\nIt gives fire damage, increasing the variety of damage types that you do.\n\n\nThe Sparkle Hands\nAmazing gloves that, after the first hit, will give Lightning Charges. These then provide bonus 1 damage lightning and can stack for a small explosion.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly, unlocks Misty Step​ after each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding \nDoes not slow down the movement, but the terrain effects still apply.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet\nGreat amulet that will be useful for most of the game. With its actions, it is the perfect choice for Monk.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed, making it easier to reach your next target.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws."

        "Act 2 changes the landscape, and there will be a lot of dark areas. Moreover, it will provide some amazing items for you to find, which will improve the build damage. This is also where I recommend equipping Knife of the Undermountain King and a shield if you can. Besides that, there are a few weapon options if you cannot do that. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-handed)\nShadow Blade\nYou can obtain this weapon when equipping Shadow Blade Ring. The weapon deals good damage, and it can be doubled using Resonance Stone.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nHaving this weapon equipped will increase critical roll range. This is important once you start attacking mainly with bonus actions.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nMust use weapon if not using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nJusticiar's Scimitar\nIts unique effect can be used to deal bonus damage without breaking concealment. Just be sure to wear this on the main hand.\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nOne of the best weapons in the game, which also fits well with the build. It requires a specific evil decision to be accessible, but gives Blinded​​ immunity, which is essential when using Darkness.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough.\n\n\nHead\nDark Justiciar Helmet\nA more powerful version, but it requires Medium Armor Proficiency.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nThis headwear will lead you through the rest of the playthrough unless you have medium armor proficiency for other options.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nIf you have this, it is still a solid choice.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you can wear medium armor, this is an amazing choice as you can scale its Armour Class beyond +2 from Dexterity and does not impose stealth.\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nStill a solid option throughout Act 2 due to bonus Dexterity, before getting ASI +2 Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nDeals bonus necrotic damage with unarmed attacks and can apply Bleeding. Also deals bonus damage with weapon attacks, perfect for what is Ninja build is aiming.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nThe boots are still a good option in Act 2.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nBonus armor class for higher survivability.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet\nThe amulet is great as it allows for the restoration of Ki Points.\n\n\nSurgeon's Subjugation Amulet\nIt can be an effective amulet against humanoid enemies and fully paralyze them.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting Shield​ spell, can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nAn offensive ring that gives bonus damage against Lightly Obscured​ enemies.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nIf you use Darkness​ heavily and don't have Shar's Spear of Evening, this ring is perfect to avoid being Blinded​.\n\n\nShadow Blade Ring\nEnables you to use Shadow Blade, which deals good damage, and gives an easy advantage. Its damage can also be doubled using Resonance Stone.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nProvides an Advantage on attack rolls. This is a mandatory ring as it will both guarantee more hits and a higher chance of critical hits.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour class is a good bonus, and the ring still takes place."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible, you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. There are a few weapon setups that I could recommend: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One - Handed)\nCrimson Mischief\nThis is perfect for those who attack with their main hand and use bonus actions for Shadow Step​ + Flurry of Blows​. Wear Rhapsody in the offhand and enjoy bonuses with Scarlet Remittance,​ which apply both to weapon and fist attacks.\n\n\nRhapsody\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThese are other weapon recommendations that are perfect to be worn in the offhand and act as stat sticks. Dolor Amarus works only on weapon attacks, but can give a huge damage increase if you can guarantee 100% crit chance with Hold Person​/Hold Monster. Blade of the First Blood is also a decent stat stick with crit chance increase and retaliation effect.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThe club is still an offhand option if you are not using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Frost Giant Strength. For a fully evil playthrough: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nNow, this is not as powerful as Crimson Mischief in pure damage. However, it is still good and has interesting, unique effects, like Blinded​ immunity. Now, for the other equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nThe Dead Shot(BiS)\nIncreases critical range and is perfect for improving damage. However, this requires Longbow proficiency; it's not a big problem if you are not using ranged attacks, as that does not bring any downsides for melee combat. Otherwise, you would have to be an Elf to have the proficiency.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from your race.\n\n\nHead\nHorns of the Berserker\nI think the best option for the helmet is thanks to a necrotic damage boost. This is better than a critical range boost. Otherwise, use the ones from Act 2.\n\n\nHelmet of Grit\nI think this would be the best helmet as you could do an additional Flurry of Blows​ attack with Bonus action. However, this requires you to have less than 50% HP. If you decide to use this, be sure to equip Amulet of Greater Health. So this does come with it's own risks.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until they get hit for that turn.\n\n\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nEnsures an easy way to become invisible and leave combat.\n\n\nShade-Slayer Cloak\nThe cloak can serve a purpose for the build, as you often attack from hiding. However, it should not take priority over survivability; the additional critical range is not that strong when you average everything.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis is the crème de la crème of this build. It is ridiculously powerful armor, that doubles the damage of piercing weapons. If you are using your weapon attacks to some extent, just take this if the story choices allow.\n\n\nElegant Studded Leather\nAlthough not as good as the one above, the Shield​ spell can be a lifesaver.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nIf you can wear medium armour, this is another great option for a Ninja build.\n\n\nGloves\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nAs the build relies on Tavern Brawler​, you can use this item to set strength to 23, and enjoy good bonuses both for unarmed and weapon attacks.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nExcellent gloves, as they work both on weapon and unarmed attacks, covering all your damage options.\n\n\nGloves of Soul Catching\nIf you mostly rely on Flurries, these gloves are crazy. They give the highest bonus damage of 1d10\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots(BiS)\nThese boots are amazing. Although you would lose some damage, its advantages of overcoming Difficult Terrain​ are nothing to take lightly.\n\n\nBoots of Uninhibited Kushigo\nVery good boots that you obtain early in Act 3. For this reason, you should also have your Wisdom modifier positive.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet(BiS)\nThe upgraded version of the amulet is a perfect choice for a Monk.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIt makes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. Use this together with the Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nMagic Amulet\nGives an Advantage on attack. I would use this only if you do not have Risky Ring. Otherwise, this does not provide much use, besides Saving Throw Advantage.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nA perfect ring for bonus damage. It requires the enemy to be Lightly Obscured.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nGives an easy advantage if you find yourself having a low hit chance of less than 80%.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nIf you use Darkness​ heavily and don't have Shar's Spear of Evening, this ring is perfect to avoid the Blinded​ effect.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armor class is a good bonus, and the ring still takes place."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStil the best gloves for the Cleric.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying various conditions.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nThis will help with building Radiating Orb stacks. However, with all the effects you will be applying, this might be overkill as you will already be proccing Luminous Armour.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds another Dazed effect that can be procced after 5 Reverbation stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMourning Frost\nAlthough this staff does not give improved Spell Save DC, it gives unique effects with cold spells like Ice Knife. Moreover, the staff comes with a Ray of Frost​ cantrip.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nThe best staff for caster in Act 1 as it gives bonus Spell Save DC, improving spell success.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nIf this is free, you could use it to get some bonuses from The Protecty Sparkswall armor.\n\n\nTorch\nDo you think I am joking? Fortunately, no. With Shillelagh​ spell this becomes one of the strongest early-game weapons able to surpass in damage all two-handed weapons. You can even dual-wield these, to have strong killers for most of Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is a great way to get some bonus damage, especially if you cannot reach the target. Only works if you are a Drow.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe only truly relevant headwear for Act 1. There are other options but they are just side bonuses.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best caster armor in Act 1.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armor, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nBracers of Defence\nThe +2 Armour class is a big boost especially if you do not have a shield proficiency.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves can be useful when using spells like Ice Knife​ and later Ice Storm. I would keep them.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots, although I would leave them for a frontline character if their slots are free. Can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nI would say there is a niche use of this early in the game when you can cast Healing Word​ with bonus action to buff your allies.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nThe ring can be useful if you are running with a dual-wield Torch in the early game."

This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\nThese hand crossbows are excellent if you need to weaponize your bonus action.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nThe best caster headwear in Act 2.\n\n\nColdbrim Hat\nAlthough this works only once per turn, it works well with spells that target Dexterity like Sleet Storm.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nDeal additional damage to the attackers.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you need a higher Armour Class and The Protecty Sparkswall is taken, this is a perfect alternative.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nYou can wear this if The Protecty Sparkswall is taken.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nYou have access to Lightning and Thunder damage sources. Moreover, you can easily get Radiant damage via Callous Glow Ring. I would only recommend these if they are not used by another character like Cleric.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class.\n\n\nAmulet\nStrange Tendril Amulet\nI like Evard's Black Tentacles​ spell, as it is a very strong crowd-control option.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn. This is useful before you obtain the Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRings\nEversight Ring\nIf you have a Darkness​ party, or members who use this spell, being able to see inside, can make you extremely sturdy.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring, that you can activate its effects with your control spells.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring\nA good ring that can apply additional radiant damage per target."

If it is free, feel free to use it and activate relevant Kereska's Favour based on the spells you use. My favorite picks are Frost of Dark Winter and Bolts of Doom.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nVery powerful stave that also gives access to Arcane Battery, giving a free (including level 6) spell cast.\n\n\nWoe\nGives additional effects like healing.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +2\nA solid hand crossbow that you can obtain in Act 3.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nThe best caster headwear, that gives +2 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nThe helmet can be used to be able to see in Darkness​ if your group utilizes this spell.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nThe best cloak in the game for casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nOne of the best caster items in general, as it gives Constitution Saving Throw an advantage, resulting in less spell cancelation.  Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nGives bonus Armour Class and improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives bonuses to Spell Save DC, which will increase spell success chance.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nGives +1 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nThese gloves will be able to apply Reverbation via your Lightning spells. However, they will trigger only once, with Call Lightning, making it a bit underwhelming. These might also be used by Cleric, so I would prioritize there.\n\n\nQuickspell Gloves\nAllows casting spells with bonus action once per short rest.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nYou can avoid failing a saving throw using a reaction. This might break your concentration and ruin the whole encounter.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nGives bonus armor class and increased saving throw rolls.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nAlthough this is the best amulet of the caster, generally it is best in the slot for cleric builds. However, I would not skip this if you are playing this build as a main character.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt allows restoring spell slots easily.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThe only ring that gives access to +1 Spell Save DC. This effect is not listed.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nStill a good ring from Act 1, that will work with some of your spells.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nAllows creating patches of Ice, with spells like Cone of Cold.\n\n\nRing of Evasion\nAllows avoiding the fail of Dexterity saving throw. These usually are wide-area spells."

        "For most of Act 1, your melee weapon slots will be free, so use anything there. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2.\n\n\nShining Staver-of-Skulls\nAn excellent cleric item alternative that comes with Light​ effect and a radiant damage rider to activate Radiating Orb.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody​ before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use a healing spell like the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

        "So once you unlock Paladin multiclass, the build can now effectively land melee hits. However, there are some issues. Overall you have a decent Dexterity of 16. Finesse weapons like Phalar Aluve can be used with this ability and get a decent hit chance. However, for weapons like Blood of Lathander you will need high strength. You can, of course, shuffle around with ability points, decrease Dexterity, and call it a day. But in that case, the build loses a lot of potential and I would rather recommend using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. This will set the strength to 21. With hit chance fixed you can then land successful hits with Divine Smite​ and greatly improve the cleric damage output. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nThe weapon is a perfect pick, if you are okay with using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nUse this weapon if you do not plan on using the Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to improve the hit chance.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nStill the best bow, as initiative plays a vital role for Light Cleric.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nAdds +1 Spell Save DC improving spell success.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nStil the best gloves for the Nature Cleric.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nAlternative option, that will add 2 more Radiating Orb stacks as you inflict damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying various conditions.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe ring's bonus radiant damage will help activate Gloves of Belligerent Skies and get more Reverbation stacks.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use a healing spell like the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nThis will help with building Radiating Orb stacks. However, with all the effects you will be applying, this might be overkill as you will already be proccing Luminous Armour.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring that can be used to apply Mental Fatigue from failed Saving Throws against your spells.\n\n\nRing of Spiteful Thunder\nAdds another Dazed effect that can be procced after 5 Reverbation stacks are activated and Thunder damage gets applied."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Sacred Star\nAn interesting weapon that applies Radiating Orb on a hit. It's not better than other options, but definitely an alternative if you want to try out something new.\n\n\n-\nWeapons from previous acts.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nGontr Mael\nCan be used to cast Haste.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nOne of the best headwear for spellcasters, giving +2 Spell Save DC. This can be contested by other casters as it is in high demand.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nImproves Spell Save DC. However, the main caveat is that this cloak is in demand by all casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nStill the best armor in the game for cleric build.\n\n\nGloves\nThe Reviving Hands\nGloves for buffing allies with healing spells.\n\n\n-\nReuse the same gloves from previous acts.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nProvides +2 Spell Save DC. However, it is better used on Cleric to get the bonus Channel Divinity charge.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nAllows restoring any level of spell slot.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nAn excellent amulet to improve the rolls against mental saving throws.\n\n\nKhalid's Gift\nIt can be used to get the Aid​ spell and increase Wisdom by 1.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nA somewhat overlooked ring, but it gives +1 Spell Save DC. It can help land that initial spell.\n\n\n-\nRings from previous acts"

        "At the start of the game, you will mostly play as a standard cleric. So this means that you should be using the normal weapons. The transition to Monk playstyle will happen later on. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nBlood of Lathander\nExtremely good weapon if you do not care about Phalar Aluve unique effects. The Lathander's Light​ effect will help you activate additional debuffs from enemies and make combat easier in Act 2.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is one of the best weapons in the game for a supporting class like Cleric. If you can precast its Phalar Aluve: Melody before combat, I recommend using it both to improve companion damage or attack rolls.\n\n\nDefender Flail\nIf you do not care about the unique effects, this is a go-to choice. The bonus Armour Class will help you avoid enemy hits and activate Holy Lance Helm.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThis is the best armor for the whole game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nOne of the best gloves for builds that apply status effects via various damage sources. This will create Reverbation, increasing the chance of making the enemy Prone.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. Perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​/Mass Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots that improve movement capabilities, especially useful when you are running around with Spirit Guardians​ active.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use a healing spell like the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nExcellent ring that will allow you to move around more. This is especially useful before you obtain Tempestuous Magic​ from Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

        "The build starts taking shape in Act 2, at about level 7, when you will do the respec, and obtain Monk levels. To be fair the build can use weapons, as you will be mostly using your fists with bonus action attacks. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nOptional item, that can be used instead of Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, to activate Tavern Brawler.\n\n\n-\nItems from previous acts\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nStill the best bow, as initiative plays a vital role for Light Cleric.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply Radiating Orb and Reverbation on enemies using Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nInflicts radiant damage when avoiding enemy attacks. In turn, this will apply a Radiant Orb or Revebration.\n\n\nCloak\nThunderskin Cloak\nBecause most of the enemies you come across will have Reverbation this cloak will further help to weaken those foes.\n\n\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nOnce you start using unarmed attacks, these gloves are pretty good with bonus damage and the possibility of inflicting bleeding.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nPerfect for use with all the radiant setups. Pick the preferred debuff - Radiant Orb vs Reverbation based on gear availability or other criteria.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nStill the best boots in terms of applying reverbation.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis will be the easiest source of Radiant damage for the time being so that you would apply Radiating Orb with your fist attacks.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nI do think this is a valuable ring, especially as the movement speed of Monk with armor will be limited."

        "For the endgame, the build has numerous variations. It all falls down to, how well at debuffing enemies you want to be, or you rather gain stronger monk attacks. I will leave this for you to decide and list a few gear options. You can also decide to use weapons and use them as stat sticks or enjoy their effects. The main reason is that the monk gets access to Stunning Strike (Melee), which does not necessarily require an unarmed main hand. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Sacred Star\nAn interesting weapon that applies Radiating Orb on a hit. It's not better than other options, but definitely an alternative if you want to try out something new.\n\n\n-\nWeapons from previous acts.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nGontr Mael\nIt can be used to cast Haste.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThe best option in terms of offensive power. It gives additional bonus action if your HP is below 50%. I do recommend using Amulet of Greater Health together, to maximize the survivability of the build.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nStill relevant as it helps to debuff against enemies that miss you.\n\n\nHorns of the Berserker\nProvides additional damage for unarmed attacks.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nProvides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nCan be used for additional daze effect if you are using reverbation items like Boots of Stormy Clamour and Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nStill the best armor in the game for cleric build.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Soul Catching\nThe best gloves in terms of offensive power, specifically for monks. The 1d10 damage rider is very powerful.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\nPerfect for use with all the radiant setups. Pick the preferred debuff - Radiant Orb vs Reverbation based on gear availability or other criteria.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nThe best amulet in terms of combat potential. Together with Helmet of Grit, you can have a decent amount of HP even at 50%, and improve the number of attacks.\n\n\nKhalid's Gift\nIt can be used to get the Aid​ spell and increase Wisdom by 1. It can be an alternative to Auntie Ethel Hair, to round up ability scores.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nA powerful amulet that gives additional Channel Divinity charge and improved Spell Save DC.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nAn excellent amulet to improve the rolls against mental saving throws.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe radiant damage rider is still a good option even with Manifestation of Soul​ unlocked.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproved movement speed is useful to get to enemies.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA good ring to help maintain Armour Class to avoid enemy attacks."

        "This part of the game is where Arcane Archer shines the most. For this reason, getting good gear and boosting your hit chance will do wonders for your combat performance. The \"Radiant\" setup will not yet work, so you will be playing just a standard archer. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nUse this together with Titanstring Bow if you skip on Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. This will be a good +4 damage boost on all shots.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nThis will probably be a far-fetched fantasy, but if you don't have a caster, this can be used to improve the success chance of landing your Arrow effects.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nA very popular stat stick weapon. I would say this has the lowest priority. It can be dual-wielded with Club of Hill Giant Strength if you decide to skip shields. I do not recommend that in the early-mid game.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nIn terms of pure damage, this bow is the top option for the whole game. Use either Club of Hill Giant Strength or Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to maximize your damage.\n\n\nHarold\nSpecial crossbow that can debuff enemies with Bane​ and make it easier to land Arcane Shot effects.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nThis bow can be deadly with Gloves of Baneful Striking for frightening enemies and increasing your damage.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a reeling effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from the priestess in the Goblin camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nIf you can spare this item, it can be a big damage boost based on the Intelligence modifier. It does conflict with multiclass, but more about that in the Act 3 gear section.\n\n\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nOpens up opportunities for easy ways to improve Spell Save DC and the success of Arcane Shots.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, which is great for better positioning to land your shots.\n\n\nGrymskull Helm\nIt can be a useful helmet for its bonuses and access to Hunter's Mark​ for Act 1.\n\n\nWarped Headband of Intellect\nSemi-useful headwear that could be used till level 8. Wearing it allows you to respec, set Intelligence to 8, and put points elsewhere. However, later on, once you get a third feat, you will want to maximize your intelligence in natural ways.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nMake sure to get this armor. You will not wear it yet, but it will be the core part of the build later on.\n\n\nAdamantine Splint Armour\nTo be fair, I would be indifferent to which armor you pick. But the heavy one does give higher bonuses, and you have proficiencies to wear them.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe best starter medium armor. You can just take it from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nBe sure to get these gloves. You do not yet need them, but they will be used later once you get War Cleric dip.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nI recommend at least getting these gloves. They apply Bane​ on targets that you hit, making it easier to land Arcane shots. For Act 1, they are not as mandatory to wear.\n\n\nGloves of Archery\nYour ranged attacks deal an additional 2 damage, one of the best options for early game gloves.\n\n\nGloves of Power\nApplies Bane​ effect, which does come with a caveat, enemies need ot fail a saving throw, and the effect is not guaranteed. This will help with landing any further Arcane Shots.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThese boots are very powerful with arcane shots and later with Radiating Orb​ effects. They provide Reverberation​ to weaken foes and even make targets Prone.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game, giving easy traversal options and avoiding any difficult terrains and their effects.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nSimple yet effective boots, allowing you to avoid attacks of opportunity.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of damage, this is one of the best amulets in the game. You can just drink a Potion of Healing and get its benefit.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nUsing a bonus action, you can weaken a foe and deal double damage with your weapon.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGrants Misty Step​ for moving on the battlefield.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed for better positioning."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nThis is a great weapon that you can wear as a stat stick. It has a special action - Moonmote​ that can further enhance radiant damage.\n\n\n-\nSame as Act 1\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nJust used for buffing the main weapon; after that, it can be unequipped.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nContinues to be the best bow for now.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield in terms of utility, as it improves Spell Save DC and Arcane Shot success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it, you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply control over key enemies.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis is the best helmet for the build. It is highly in demand by other Gish-type builds. I would say the build even depends on it to be effective.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nAn alternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity, but you will need to use Drakethroat Glaive with Draconic Elemental Weapon: Thunder​ effect to apply thunder damage rider. This way, you can easily stack Arcane Acuity​ and improve Spell Save DC with your arrows.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nAlternative headwear, before Helmet of Arcane Acuity, or if it is taken.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives an additional attack roll bonus, and works perfectly with ranged weapons if you decide to use them.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor to take is once you get War Cleric with Divine Favour​ and Callous Glow Ring. This will help you to apply Radiating Orb​ easily on all targets.\n\n\nDwarven Splintmail\nA solid armor, with high Armour Class, and other relevant bonuses.\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in Act 2. With high dexterity, it can have the highest Armour Class of all gear options in this stage of the game.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nBoth of these are great gloves, use the first ones if they are accessible, as you will already get plenty Radiating Orb​ effects. Otherwise, use the Luminous Gloves.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best overall shoes with an easy Reverberation​ option. It can be activated by using the Arcane Shots.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nAs you can get Concentration effect via Guidance, Divine Favour, etc., this can be helpful if you precast it. Otherwise, I would use other boots.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet, if you were able to obtain it.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nGives an easy way to deal additional radiant damage with each shot.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nApplies Mental Fatigue debuff, weakening enemies and increasing further debuffs or spell success chance.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nYou can use Drakethroat Glaive to apply Cold damage to your weapon and create Ice fields with your attacks.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks."

        "Here is an important disclaimer and about the build in general, depending on the gear you can access: If you are not able to use Helmet of Arcane Acuity or Hat of Storm Scion's Power, you will have to opt in for Diadem of Arcane Synergy. However, to use it, you will have to make a slight change to the build. You will need to do a respec and pick the first level as War Cleric and finish with 11 levels of Fighter. This will allow you to use Intelligence as a spellcasting modifier on items instead of a Cleric's Wisdom. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nRhapsody\nAll of these items are excellent stat sticks. Rhapsody + Dolor Amarus are the best in terms of damage, especially if you could guarantee critical hits with Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nIt can be used by an ally to buff everyone. If you use it yourself, it will interfere with Divine Favour due Concentration effect.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters, as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role, giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nRanged\nGontr Mael\nThe highlight of this build. Truly a light-themed weapon. It offers various effects, but the main highlight is Bolt of Celestial Light,​ giving a radiant damage boost.\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nContinues to be the best bow. For Act 3, you can chug Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength for even more bonus damage or continue using Club of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nThe lower priority bow, in case you do not have access to the ones above.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nI would say this is the best headwear for the build if you can afford to use it, and have no other Gish build. The increased Spell Save DC will make it easy to land arrow effects and disable your foes.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nAn alternative to Helmet of Arcane Acuity, but you will need to use Drakethroat Glaive with Draconic Elemental Weapon: Thunder​ effect to apply thunder damage rider. This way, you can easily stack Arcane Acuity​ and improve Spell Save DC with your arrows.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nSecond-best headwear, as you get additional damage based on the Intelligence modifier. If you are not using Helmet of Arcane Acuity, I would urge you to equip Gloves of Baneful Striking to maintain the high chance of Arcane arrow success.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe main armor of this build, on which the build relies. It allows for easy application Radiating Orb​ effects with radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nPick either of these gloves as they give an easy way to apply Radiating Orb​ or Reverberation​ effects.\n\n\nLuminous Gloves\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese gloves can be used to get a slight boost to Spell Save DC and bonus fire damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe Boots of Stormy Clamour would be the best option, which you should aim to use for maximum effectiveness with this build.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of damage, Broodmother's Revenge is the best. Amulet of The Devout is also useful as it improves Spell Save DC and Arcane Arrow success. However, I would prioritize this on Cleric or any other caster.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nGives an easy way to deal additional radiant damage with each shot.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nApplies Mental Fatigue debuff, weakening enemies and increasing further debuffs or spell success chance.\n\n\nSnowburst Ring\nYou can use Drakethroat Glaive to apply Cold damage to your weapon and create Ice fields with your attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves Armour Class."

        "The goal is to get the best Rapier and Scimitar weapons as early as possible. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThis is a perfect weapon from the early game up to the late game. If you want a more \"optimized\" setup, I would go with it. You can also take Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat and wield it with two hands, for a big boost to damage. The highlight is Phalar Aluve: Melody,​ which allows you to buff allies or debuff enemies, depending on what is needed more.\n\n\nRupturing Blade\nThis weapon is a bit risky to use, but it does come with a pretty good unique effect, Searing Blood.\n\n\nRapier +1\nThese are the first weapons that I would recommend. To be fair, I am in favour of Rapier +1 due to its +1 enchantment. The Speedy Reply doesn't have it, but it does provide a unique effect, granting Momentum.\n\n\nSpeedy Reply\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nYou can use shields once you get the proficiency from Hexblade. If your race provides it, that's even better.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nExcellent headwear that gives Arcane Synergy. You can easily trigger it with Booming Blade.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nI think this is the best Act 1 armour, as it gives +2 Dexterity, which translates into multiple benefits. Make sure to cast Mage Armour​ on yourself from an ally caster if you are not wearing any other light or medium pieces.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nWith the hexblade dip, you are able to wear medium armor. They alleviate any Armour Class problems for Act 1 and simplify progression.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves are the two best options. The Gloves of the Growling Underdog give a pretty easy advantage, and as a swashbuckler, you will try to stay close to the enemies. The Gloves of Baneful Striking are an excellent choice for debuffs and can benefit not just you, but your allies.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGives additional armour class for survivability.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves against ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game with all the bonuses and easy use of Misty Step.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots can easily apply Reverberation​ via Booming Blade or any of the dirty tricks. I think this build can somewhat as a debuffer, especially as you will be using Phalar Aluve: Melody.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nAllows movement without limits on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source, for the mid-game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nUse this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The Arcane Synergy​ effect is easy to activate with Booming Blade.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nInfernal Rapier\nBoth of these weapons are average, but they do look cool. They are obtained somewhat later in Act 2, so be aware of that. You will have to push through to Act 3 for a really powerful weapon.\n\n\nJusticiar's Scimitar\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield in Act 2. It also gives a bonus spell saved DC, which works with the swashbuckler's Dirty Tricks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nStill serves as the best headwear in terms of damage boost. If another character is using it, an alternative is Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nCan be used to stack Arcane Acuity​ which improves the success of Bard spells and Dirty Tricks.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIt can give a marginal boost to damage with a decrease in critical hit rolls.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nA distant option to improve Spell Save DC and initiative. I would say this is a low priority and would rather use this on a dedicated caster. But the dirty tricks like Dirty Trick: Flick o' the Wrist​ can benefit from it.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nOne of the best-looking armors in the game. You can wear them, and they provide useful bonuses like an Advantage on stealth checks. The main highlight is Shar's Aegis,​ which improves Armour Class and gives you an option to wear Strange Conduit Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in this stage, with a decent Armour Class boost, and not limited by +2 Dexterity modifier.\n\n\nStudded Leather Armour +2\nIt can be obtained late in Act 2, once you reach level 9. Solid armor, the main draw is its decent 15 Armour Class.\n\n\nShadeclinger Armour\nThe advantage of saving throws is usually overlooked. Still, this is an excellent bonus, enabling better spell and various effects resistance.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAll of these gauntlets are great options as they give a permanent damage rider. Just choose which damage you prefer - fire or necrotic.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThis can be an alternative to Gloves of Baneful Striking, and you can activate their effect with Booming Blade. This will help you land any of the Dirty Tricks. But I do think it is redundant, compared to other options.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA very good ring that inherits damage from your weapon and works especially well in Act 2.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nCan be easily activated thanks to Booming Blade​ on the first attack. Use this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nYou can use any spell with Concentration or even armors like Dark Justiciar Half-Plate with Shar's Aegis​ to enable its effect for bonus damage.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThis ring is an option, as having a high hit chance makes it easier to land your dirty tricks and debuff enemies.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill good options from Act 1 that prove useful, especially in the first hours.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nProvides +1 Armour Class to avoid hits."

        "There are two setups that I recommend, each of which depends on whether you want to lean more on the Dirty Tricks or use some spellcasting and embrace a spellsword build. Helmet of Grit Setup This setup aims to get additional bonus action, which allows the use Dirty Trick: Flick o' the Wrist​ and something like Dueller's Enthusiasm​ in one turn. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThis helmet gives an additional bonus action when you have less than 50% HP. For this reason, I urge you to get the Amulet of Greater Health to maximize it and retain good survivability.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nI would say this is a key item for the build. Pair it with Helmet of Grit for additional bonus action, which greatly improves what you can do - another dirty trick or maybe Perfectly Balanced Strike.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option to wear, as the helmet slot will be taken by Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nDeals additional damage that is inherited from your weapon. This does require being Lightly Obscured, which is easy to achieve. Spellsword setup This setup aims to use illusion and enchantment spells (Hypnotic Pattern, Fear, etc.) in addition to dirty tricks. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis helmet will allow easily stack Arcane Acuity​ and reach a very high success chance for spells.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nSo, without Helmet of Grit, the Amulet of Greater Health is not such a huge priority, even some previous act amulets work well, and you can maximize your damage with Broodmother's Revenge.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\n\n\nAny other amulet\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option to wear, as you cannot wear Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThis ring will allow casting spells like Hypnotic Pattern​ with a bonus action. Other Items Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nDuellist's Prerogative\nThese are the best weapons that I recommend for this build. Duellist's Prerogative is my best recommendation option. Still, if for some reason you want to avoid it, the other two weapons can be paired with shield, for some bonus armour class.\n\n\nCrimson Mischief\n\n\nBelm\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nThe ultimate bow for a stat stick. It gives a special effect, which inflicts additional critical damage with any weapon hit. You can easily guarantee critical hits with Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed. I would only use this if you are concentrating on melee attacks and spell casting.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe +1 initiative is still good.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nIf you have a Cleric in the party with Revorb setup, or you use Boots of Stormy Clamour, this cloak can easily apply Dazed.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nTo be fair, it is hard to recommend anything besides Bhaalist Armour. It's Aura Of Murder​ is such a huge damage boost that it outranks any other option. With the high number of attacks you can do, this can reach some huge numbers.\n\n\nHelldusk Armour\n\n\nArmour of Agility\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nAny of these gloves will prove useful in my opinion. Helldusk Gloves give some fire damage and Spell Save DC for landing tricks. Legacy of the Masters is better in terms of weapon damage potential, and with Bhaalist Armour, their bonuses are doubled.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves can be ridiculously overpowered if you can guarantee critical hits.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Persistence\nThere are plenty of boot options, and all of them are good. The main outlier might be Boots of Stormy Clamour, which gives an easy way to apply Reverberation​ with all the tools at Swashbuckler and Sword Bard's disposal.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\n-\nBoots from previous acts."

        "For most of Act 1, your melee weapon slots will be free, so use anything there. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nThe best stat stick in Act 1, giving a boost to crit range and dice rerolls.\n\n\nSussur Dagger\nA decent offhand weapon to silence caster enemies, but this is a very niche use case.\n\n\nRitual Dagger\nIt can be used to buff your attack rolls.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis should be used together with Titanstring Bow for improved damage from strength ability.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action and main action.\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nIn general, this is the best bow in the game. Sadly, it does limit the rogue somewhat as you will not be able to shoot with bonus action. However, if you are looking for long-range stealth shooting this weapon is the perfect pick. You will need improved strength either via Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or Club of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThis is the best helmet in terms of damage improvements. It requires you to inflict a condition, which sometimes happens from a simple attack or avoiding hits.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nI think the melee aspect of the build greatly benefits from this helmet, so I recommend it.\n\n\nCloak\n-\n-\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nIt is an excellent armor that gives an advantage on dexterity ability checks. I would also recommend taking Mage Armour​ to get an additional +3 Armour Class.\n\n\nSpidersilk Armour\nThe best light armor in Act 1, with good bonuses. It also looks cool!\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Archery\nGives a slight boost to ranged damage from your hand crossbows.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves to reduce the damage of incoming ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game. The Misty Step​ is a great way to get bonus mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nMakes it easier to move on difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Branding\nCan be used to enable enemy weakness to specific damage types. This is great if you have party members that use similar weapon type to yours, so you could easily gang up on a single foe.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe only amulet in the game that gives direct damage increase, can be activated with a single health potion before combat.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nA solid ring with a +2 acid damage bonus on your weapon attacks.\n\n\nSmuggler's Ring\nOne of the best rings for early-game pickpocketing.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nA good movement boost makes it easier to reach those targets."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nJusticiar's Scimitar\nA +2 enchantment weapon. It has a special attack that does not break concealment allowing do land an additional hit with 1d6 psychic damage.\n\n\nAssassin's Shortsword\nThe weapon gives an advantage on stealth checks. Generally, if you are using The Graceful Cloth I would disregard this item.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nYou can imbue a weapon with any element 1d4 damage and gain a +1 to attack rolls. You can get the bonus elemental damage on any weapon. For example, drop another weapon on the ground, cast the spell with this glaive, and equip the said weapon. This is a very powerful combo, which can be irritating to activate.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis should be used together with Titanstring Bow for improved damage from strength ability.\n\n\nRanged\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nThe best hand crossbow for now with +2 enchantment.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\nA decent hand crossbow with a force damage modifier. You will also get access to level 3 Magic Missile​ which can be used to finish off specific foes.\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nIn general, this is the best bow in the game. Sadly, it does limit the rogue somewhat as you will not be able to shoot with bonus action. However, if you are looking for long-range stealth shooting this weapon is the perfect pick. You will need improved strength either via Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or Club of Hill Giant Strength.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option in terms of offensive power as you will get increased damage based on the spellcasting modifier - Intelligence.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nBy landing a solid shot with your weapon you can increase Spell Save DC for the next turn and cast a spell with a high success chance for the next turn. This is especially potent with Magical Ambush.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nA slight boost to ranged attack rolls.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nCloak of Cunning Brume\nUsing this cloak you can create foggy cloud to empower the stealthy playstyle.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nAlthough you will not be able to wear these (until you take the Fighter Lv 1 dip), I do recommend getting at least the first armor.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nGives initiative and a higher Armour Class boost from dexterity without imposing any disadvantages on stealth checks. It is medium armor, so be sure you have a relevant proficiency.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nGives a necrotic damage bonus and gives a unique bonus action for even more damage.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nIt gives a bonus of 1d4 damage, which is a good boost to melee damage.\n\n\nGloves of the Balanced Hands\nIt can help you improve the offhand attack of the hand crossbow.\n\n\nIchorous Gloves\nIt can be used together with Caustic Band for acid damage interaction.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game. The Misty Step​ is a great way to get bonus mobility.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nSlightly improves Armour Class resulting in a higher survivability.\n\n\nAmulet\n-\nPrevious Act Amulets.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nThe Shield​ spell is pretty good, but as Arcane Trickster you will already have access to it.\n\n\nRings\nCaustic Band\nA solid ring with a +2 acid damage bonus on your weapon attacks.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nCan be used to slightly improve damage while being obscured. Especially effective in Act 2.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nOnce you reach level 9 and unlock Magical Ambush​ this ring can help with debuffing foes when you scroll cast.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nIt can be useful if your party utilizes the Darkness​ spell.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThe item is a good option. However, in most cases you will be using stealth, and gaining Advantage will be pretty easy.\n\n\nShapeshifter's Boon Ring\nCan be used to improve pickpocketing chances."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nDolor Amarus\nIn the best-case scenario, two of these can be equipped which would result in an additional 14 damage when landing a critical hit.\n\n\nAmbusher\nThe weapon's bonus 1d6 Necrotic damage rider also applies to ranged attacks.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nImproves crit range and allows retaliating against attacker enemy. It also offers bonus armor class when worn in offhand.\n\n\nClub of Hill Giant Strength\nThis should be used together with Titanstring Bow for improved damage from strength ability.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +2\nThis should replace the Ne'er Misser as the +2 enchantment is better.\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nThe bow can fit in neatly with Helmet of Arcane Acuity and Band of the Mystic Scoundrel combo. This way you can hit with Arrow of Many Targets on the first hit (maybe even land a Sneak Attack (Ranged)​ via reaction) and leave bonus action for a control spell. Just remember you will still need some strength bonus from something like Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or Club of Hill Giant Strength to make the bow damage worthwhile.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThis is a very powerful helmet. I do recommend equipping Amulet of Greater Health to overcome the issues of low HP. This would allow you to have two bonus actions which can be used for attacking or entering stealth mid-combat.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nWith a high spellcasting modifier, the bonus damage is decent.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nCan be used together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel to cast using bonus action. This means that your main action will be utilized for landing an attack and building Spell Save DC with Arrow of Many Targets.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nImproves survivability by reducing the chances of being hit.\n\n\nCloak of The Weave\nMight be a strange suggestion, and I would prioritize it on a caster. However, the bonus spell save DC can help with landing the initial spell.\n\n\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nI would put a low priority on this cloak. The Arcane Trickster does not have Extra Attack​ which makes it less likely that you will kill an enemy.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of Landfall\nProbably a strange suggestion, but this is a light armor, giving a lot of valuable features - improved Spell Save DC, Plant Growth, and Constitution Saving Throw advantage.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nBoth of these armors will work. They give very good bonuses and work especially well on stealth playstyle.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nTechnically this is the best light armor in the game, however, this will require you to be close to enemies to activate Aura Of Murder. In turn, this kind of destroys the whole playstyle that we are aiming for with this build, so I would leave it for another melee martial or archer.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese gloves will both improve the spellcasting and weapon damage.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThe strongest gloves if you can effectively incur critical damage as they create a separate instance of damage riders.\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nA somewhat powerful glove, with a major caveat of incurring self-damage for an additional attack.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nOverall good boots allowing to avoid the effects of Difficult Terrain. The highlight is that you can use Reaction to avoid a failed Saving Throw.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nSimilar to the ones above, with Freedom of Movement​ and Longstrider​ effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nThis is a perfect amulet if you use Helmet of Grit. This way the survivability will be maximized and you can easily obtain a bonus action.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nI do want to recommend this amulet, but most likely it will go on another caster. Still, the +2 Spell Save DC would be a huge helper for casting with scrolls.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe best amulet in terms of offensive prowess. The bonus damage can now be easily activated using Ring of Regeneration.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nA somewhat overlooked ring, but it gives +1 Spell Save DC. It can help land that initial spell.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThe ring is best used together with Helmet of Arcane Acuity, for an easy way to cast illusion/enchantment spells with bonus action. However, without Extra Attack​ each shot for the build is very important and limits the build potential.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nThis ring can help with debuffing foes when you scroll cast and they fail saving throws.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe armor class boost from the ring slot is valuable throughout the game.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nThis ring can be used together with Broodmother's Revenge to constantly activate the bonus poison damage."

        "Dual Wield options This potion is here if you decide to use Dual Wielder​ feat from level 4. The setup is truly powerful, especially if you can Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThe sword is so good that it would be a crime not to get it. It works on your Dazzling Breath​ and even on other spells, giving a significant damage boost, and later Arcane Acuity​ via Hat of Storm Scion's Power.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nThe best option, as it will give an easy way to activate Lightning Charges​ via Luminous Arrow​ or other spells. These will be used to proc Gloves of Belligerent Skies later down the road. Single Hand options In case Phalar Aluve is taken, you can go for this kind of setup, where you only use a main-hand weapon. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Spellsparkler\nThe best option, as it will give an easy way to activate Lightning Charges​ via Luminous Arrow​ or other spells. These will be used to proc Gloves of Belligerent Skies later down the road.\n\n\nMelf's First Staff\nThe best staff for caster in Act 1 as it gives bonus Spell Save DC, improving spell success.\n\n\nTorch\nWith the Shillelagh​ spell, this becomes one of the strongest early-game weapons able to surpass in damage all two-handed weapons. You can even dual-wield these, to have strong killers for most of Act 1.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage. It also applies a Reeling​ effect.\n\n\nAbsolute's Warboard\nDecent shield if you got Absolute's Brand from True Soul Priestess Gut (Lv. 4) in Goblin Camp.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game. Other Equipment Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is a great way to get some bonus damage, especially if you cannot reach the target. Only works if you are a Drow.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nOne of the best headwear options, giving an easy way to reflect damage and activate conditions.\n\n\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe only truly relevant headwear for Act 1. There are other options, but they are just side bonuses.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armour that you can use throughout the game. Gives an easy way to apply Radiating Orb​ on multiple enemies with various sources of radiant damage.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armour, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nA powerful glove option that will give easy Reverberation​ stacks.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nSolid glove option for a support role, to easily apply Blade Ward​ via heals.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots option for the rest of the game.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots, although I would leave them for a frontline character if their slots are free. It can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nGives access to Mass Healing Word​ and Healing Word​, which can be cast for free per long rest. This is a perfect option for the early game, where your support role will be more important.\n\n\nPearl of Power Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots, after that it can be unequipped\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for Act 1, as it gives an easy way to apply Bless​ on allies.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nThe ring can be useful if you are running with a dual-wield Torch in the early game.",
        "This covers the early parts of the game, mostly Act 1 levels 1-5: Remember to buff everyone with Longstrider.\nIf using Torch, also activate Shillelagh​ for better damage\nUse Wild Shape​ form to get a separate HP bar, but also utilize the unique interactions, Wild Shape: Spider​ - Web, Wild Shape: Deep Rothé​ - Charge, Wild Shape: Owlbear​ - for Crushing Flight. All of these will give various options to weaken foes.\nSpike Growth​ is an almighty spell that will get better as the game progresses. For now, it mainly slows down foes and inflicts damage. Use Thorn Whip, Thunderwave​ to push or pull enemies into the spiky ground.\nUse Starry Form​ to switch between the forms. I would prioritize Starry Form: Archer​ and Starry Form: Dragon. The latter is especially deadly once you get Luminous Armour and cast Dazzling Breath.\nOnce you get The Spellsparkler, you can use Starry Form: Archer​ to launch Luminous Arrow​ and activate Lightning Charges​.\nIf you can, precast Phalar Aluve: Shriek​ with Phalar Aluve. This will save you an action point and greatly empower yourself and your party with additional damage and debuffs.\nStar Map: Guiding Bolt​ is an excellent single-target spell with radiant damage. Once you reach Level 5, you get slightly improved spells: Plant Growth​ is a safe spell to cast when you wish to slow down foes without using a concentration slot.\nSleet Storm​ is another great addition; enemies get instant Prone​ check, and if they slip, they skip their turns. It also cancels enemy spell concentration.\nDaylight​ is situationally useful. Later, when you get Callous Glow Ring and fight in dark areas, it can help to activate the ring effects.\nOnce you get Gloves of Belligerent Skies, make sure to have Lightning Charges​ while Spike Growth​ is active. It will proc Reverberation."
      ],
      "2": [
        "The goal here is to get Callous Glow Ring and Gloves of Battlemage's Power. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\n-\nSame Weapons as the previous Act.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste​ without spell slots. Best used before combat, or continue using Act 1 weapons.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nWorks well with Gloves of Battlemage's Power when enemies miss you, and you both inflict damage, and apply conditions.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nWith Phalar Aluve: Shriek​ and spells like Thunderwave,​ you can build Arcane Acuity,​ which will help land other control spells like  Confusion, Hold Person, etc. It is an alternative to Gloves of Battlemage's Power\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nHelps to absorb elemental damage, which can then improve your weapon attacks.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nAs many enemies will get Reverberation​ effect from your attacks, the additional Dazed​ from the cloak is a good addition.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armour in terms of applying conditions and debuffs. Wear it, use it, love it.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThese gloves unlock a very easy Arcane Acuity​ stacking option with Spike Growth. Enemies just need to move on the spikes, and the gloves are proc. This enables you to have a high Spell Save DC and make your next spells have almost a 100% chance of success.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nA solid alternative if you want to trigger the Reverberation​ detonation faster.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nContinues to be the best boots option for easy Reverberation​ stacking.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nI would say this continues to be the best amulet option if you continue using The Whispering Promise ring.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots. After that, you can switch to another amulet.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nOne of the most important items for the build. The radiant damage rider will activate Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ from your items, giving tons of conditions to weaken your target.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nThe ring gives access to Mental Fatigue​ debuff, which can be easily activated with Dazzling Breath​. It will make landing other control spells easier.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nContinues to be a decent ring option, especially if you continue using healing spells.\n\n\nCoruscation Ring\nGives an additional source of Radiating Orb​ when casting spells.",
        "Here, there is one key item that will play a major role in boosting your area spells, mainly Spike Growth​ - the Callous Glow Ring. At level 7, make sure to always use Conjure Woodland Being; it gives free Spike Growth​ to cover a larger area of the field. Dryad can also summon Fallen Lover​ to act as a meat shield.\nIce Storm​ is a very powerful spell; it can cover the field in ice without using your concentration slot. This means you can both inflict damage and disable foes. Later, you can pair it with Insect Plague.\nWall of Fire​ is another great addition, but again, it is more situational. It is perfect in corridors, through which you force enemies and let them burn. Later, you can use Conjure Elemental: Water Elemental​ and its ice attack to apply Brittle​ on Burning​ targets.\nOnce you get Hat of Storm Scion's Power you can use it to push enemies into your area spells with Thunderwave, which will also generate Arcane Acuity.\nAnother, and stronger alternative is Gloves of Battlemage's Power, which allows building Arcane Acuity​ on the enemy's turn, as they walk through spikes of Spike Growth. On the next turn, you can follow up with an almost guaranteed control spell."
      ],
      "3": [
        "I urge having a Dual Wielder,​ which will significantly improve the combat capabilities with two weapons. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMarkoheshkir\nThis is the best staff for any caster, with access to Kereska's Favour​ and its various effects. You can choose either Bolts of Doom​ (to replace The Spellsparkler) or Bone-Shaking Thunder, which will give another source of Reverberation​ for your spells. In addition, you will get powerful offensive spells. Of course, if you plan on using other casters, they may prioritise this stave, so continue using The Spellsparkler then.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nIf dual-wielding and precasting Phalar Aluve: Shriek,​ this continues to be one of the best weapons to carry on yourself.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nStill a solid option for a source of Lightning Charges​ until you get Markoheshkir.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a significant initiative boost, helping to go earlier in combat.\n\n\n-\nAny of the previous Act weapons.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm(BiS)\nContinues to be a powerful option if you are using the recommended item combinations to activate conditions.\n\n\nHelmet of Grit\nAllows for obtaining additional bonus action for more attacks. This requires being at 50% HP or lower, so feel free to use something like Transfuse Health​ to maintain this level. With Twinkling Constellations, you can switch Starry Form​ and use their special abilities of bonus action twice. I would also urge having Amulet of Greater Health equipped, as otherwise your HP will be very low.\n\n\nHat of Storm Scion's Power\nHeadwear alternative for stacking Arcane Acuity​ and forcing control over enemies.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nThe strongest cloak in the game, with a significant boost to defensive capabilities.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour(BiS)\nContinues to be the top armour choice.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nThis armour is also an option, but probably best worn by another party member. It will double the damage of Insect Plague​ and Wall of Thorns​ against enemies via the Aura Of Murder​ effect.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power(BiS)\nThe best gloves which ensure a high Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nSolid glove alternative.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nContinues to be the best boot choice for the build.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nProbably one of the best amulets for a caster, with a significant +2 Spell Save DC boost.\n\n\nKhalid's Gift\nThis amulet can be used to round up the Wisdom value and increase spellcasting modifier bonus.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nI would say this amulet is mandatory if you plan on using Helmet of Grit. Otherwise, it's good and can help significantly with spell concentration.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nGreat defensive amulet that gives advantage on mental saving throws.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe core ring makes the build work.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nEasy source of improved spell success chance via Mental Fatigue.",
        "With Twinkling Constellations​ unlocked and a few additional features, the final build shape takes place. I also think Starry Form: Chalice​ becomes irrelevant at this stage, and only the 2 others are relevant: You can switch between Starry Form​ for free, mid-combat. Start with Starry Form: Archer, cast Luminous Arrow, activate Lightning Charges, cast Spike Growth​ and switch to Starry Form: Dragon. \nFor the second turn you can come in close, use Dazzling Breath, debuff enemies, cast Thunderwave​ or Command​ to force enemies into the spikes, so that they would incur more damage. Another option: Use Insect Plague​ and follow up with Plant Growth. This creates a slow-moving field, which damages targets each turn.\nAgain, use the various spells to force enemies into your fields - Command, Thorn Whip, etc. Also, remember to buff allies - Heroes' Feast, Longstrider, to greatly improve your combat capabilities."

They will have capabilities to utilise different Starry Form options, depending on what is needed. This means you can be both a support and a controller character in one, often replacing your party cleric. The interesting part is Twinkling Constellations, which gives a free change for the form during combat. So you can play around with Dazzling Breath and Luminous Arrow when the situation requires.",

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nUnseen Menace\nGives a very easy advantage option, greatly increasing hit chance.\n\n\nSorrow\nFor now, be sure to grab this weapon. You will need Spike Growth​ + Writhing Tide​ to effectively walk on the spikes and then pull enemies using the weapon's Sorrowful Lash.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nThese are both Dexterity-based weapons, meaning they are an option if you would like to avoid using the Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. The Phalar Aluve is one of the best support weapons thanks to Phalar Aluve: Melody. Larethian's Wrath is just a badass sword that hits multiple enemies for full damage.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\n\n\nSvartlebee's Woundseeker\nOne of the best early game weapons with a boost to attack rolls against enemies that have already received damage.\n\n\nSword of Justice\nA solid greatsword option with special shield action.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +1\nSolid ranged weapon option. Just equip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nIf the party is not running a cleric, this becomes a pretty solid headwear option.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nOne of the best headwear for pure weapon damage increase.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe Luminous Armour can play a vital role in making the build work better with Spike Growth​. You will need the Callous Glow Ring for it to work effectively.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nA solid armour option, with Reeling​ effect and damage reduction.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armour, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nGives easy advantage on attacks, making it an easy choice to counteract the effects of Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalty to attack rolls.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\nApplies the Baneful Strike​ effect, which weakens foe saving throws, making them perfect targets for control actions or spells. This can make many bosses easier, as you can now land spells with a higher chance.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of combat potential, as they will allow you to apply Reverberation​ via various interactions.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game for walking on Difficult Terrain. It also comes with Misty Step​ when you are in need of high mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nExcellent boots to help move through Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source for the mid-game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.",
        "This covers the early parts of the game, mostly Act 1 levels 1-5: The combat in the early game is pretty simple. Where possible, use Hunter's Mark​ to improve your damage.\nEnsnaring Strike​ can be used to get an easy advantage, but remember it uses full action, so it becomes less useful once you get Extra Attack​.\nUse your preferred swarm to inflict damage or apply conditions. Sometimes, even the teleport is a good option, as it costs no resources.\nDisable Great Weapon Master: All In​ if needed to increase the hit chance.\nDon't forget to buff yourself and allies with Longstrider. Level 5 - 6: Here, you will obtain Spike Growth,​ and it plays a big role further down the road. My recommendation would be to cast it, where enemies will be forced to walk on it.\nUse Legion of Bees​ to push enemies into the spikes once you land an attack."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nSorrow\nIt will be useful here once you get the Writhing Tide​ feature at level 7. You can now use Sorrowful Lash​ to pull enemies to yourself while standing inside Spike Growth.\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night\nA pretty solid weapon option that has the Moonmote​ effect. Perfect for enemies that are close to you, which inflicts additional damage, and slows them.\n\n\nShar's Spear of Evening\nA solid weapon choice that gives advantage on saving throws if the area is Lightly Obscured. Sadly, it will not be as effective if you are using Luminous Armour, which will apply Radiating Orb​.\n\n\nHalberd of Vigilance\nOne of the first weapons with a +2 enchantment comes with a Force damage rider. It has a long reach, perfect for attack of opportunities.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nThe weapon is used to enchant other weapons with Draconic Elemental Weapon​ for different elemental damage riders.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAlthough not mandatory, this bow is useful as it can apply Haste​ without spell slots. Best used before combat, or continue using Act 1 weapons.\n\n\nHead\nColdbrim Hat\nA pretty decent hat option that can activate the additional debuff of Encrusted with Frost.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves armour class and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nCloak of Elemental Absorption\nHelps to absorb elemental damage, which can then improve your weapon attacks.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nOverall, this is the best armour, as now it will synergise well with Spike Growth​ + Callous Glow Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nThe armours give advantage on constitution saving throws, making it pretty easy to maintain spell concentration\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nI would only wear this if you have 16 dexterity, to make it a competitive armour.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThese will be the best gloves for the build. They will allow to easily stack Arcane Acuity​ from various interactions and effects. The highlight is that each tick from Spike Growth​ will activate these.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nA solid glove option that comes with bonus fire damage.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots option.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nA powerful ring option that will be the cornerstone for the build. Not only does it give more damage, but it also activates Luminous Armour and other effects from items.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nA pretty solid ring option for additional psychic damage on hit while concentrating on spells.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nImproves armour class, making it easier to avoid enemy attacks.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nGives additional damage boost while the target is at least Lightly Obscured.",
        "Obtaining Callous Glow Ring, Writhing Tide​ changes your playstyle: Precast Writhing Tide​ if you can see an incoming encounter. Otherwise, use it during combat\nTry to position yourself as close as you can to the enemies, or the biggest group. Of course, near the bosses you might want to avoid them.\nCast Spike Growth​ on yourself. This will be your playing field, where you want the enemies to come.\nUse Sorrowful Lash​ from Sorrow to pull enemies toward yourself into the spikes\nUse Legion of Bees​ to push away enemies close to you, so that they would be force to move through the spikes. Once you obtain Gloves of Battlemage's Power, stuff gets serious: You can now cast Command​ on enemies with a high success chance and force them to move onto Spike Growth. It is also good on ranged foes, to force them to come to you.\nUse Radiance of the Dawn​ to deal area of effect radiant damage, and apply debuffs.\nUse Booming Blade​ to inflict additional damage with the weapon and activate Gloves of Battlemage's Power."

        "Piercing Weapons I recommend these weapon if you plan on using Bhaalist Armour. This means much higher damage, but you lose some of the debuffing capabilities of Radiating Orb​. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nShar's Spear of Evening\nListed the weapons in terms of being \"powerful\". Shar's Spear of Evening, requires an evil decision, which is not for everyone. Nyrulna is truly great weapon, and includes special actions - Zephyr Break​ and Zephyr Flash,​ which offer really good weapon actions. The last is Selûne's Spear of Night, which can kind of be good with its Moonmote​ effect, however, it is only once per long rest.\n\n\nNyrulna\n\n\nSelûne's Spear of Night Slashing Weapons If you plan on continuing to use Luminous Armour, here are the weapons that I recommend: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\nSorrow\nAlready mentioned the weapon. I would continue using it if you extensively utilized Sorrowful Lash​.\n\n\nThe Dancing Breeze\nA pretty neat weapon that comes with Whirlwind Attack​, hitting multiple enemies around you.\n\n\nNyrulna\nIts still a good weapon even without Bhaalist Armour, especially as it has neat weapon actions. Other Items Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nIn terms of pure damage boost, this is the best bow, especially as you can easily guarantee critical hits via Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a whooping +3 to initiative, almost guaranteeing being first in most encounters.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nReduces the critical roll requirements, giving a slight average damage boost.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nContinues to be the best choice if you are using Gloves of Battlemage's Power.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nEither use this or Gloves of Battlemage's Power to stack Arcane Acuity​.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nThe headwear comes with Critical hit immunity and auto-healing. This is a perfect combo with Broodmother's Revenge.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nThe strongest cloak in the game, with a significant boost to defensive capabilities.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nMy recommended armour is best in slot for the build. It will allow us to maintain the powerful synergy of Spike Growth​ + Callous Glow Ring for the Radiating Orb​ effect.\n\n\nBhaalist Armour\nIf your aim is damage, this armour gives Aura Of Murder​, which doubles piercing damage. With this in mind, Nyrulna, Shar's Spear of Evening can deal huge amounts of damage.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nSolid medium armour option with high armour class.\n\n\nArmour of Persistence\nIt's also a good option if your chosen cleric subclass will give the heavy armour proficiency.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThe best glove option to easily stack Arcane Acuity.\n\n\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nIf you dumped strength and used Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, this is a direct upgrade, freeing the elixir slot, and giving an easy way to maximise strength.\n\n\nLegacy of the Masters\nPowerful glove option, which improves both attack rolls and damage. This helps reduce Great Weapon Master: All In​ penalties.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nContinues to be the best boot option for activating Reverberation.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nGives a direct damage boost for your weapon attacks.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nGives +2 Spell Save DC and additional Channel Divinity charge for cleric abilities.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nAllows maximising Constitution, which greatly improves your spell concentration.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThe best ring in my opinion, which allows activating Luminous Armour and procs on Spike Growth​.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nGives 1d4 psychic damage while concentrating on spells.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA direct armour class boost.\n\n\nEversight Ring\nAllows you to see through Darkness​ if your party is running this mechanic.\n\n\nRing of Regeneration\nCan be equipped to automatically activate Broodmother's Revenge in combat.",
        "More cleric spells will be unlocked here: You can now switch the tide in some encounters with multi-target Hold Person​ or just use Scroll of Hold Monster to disable bosses. Use them once you have some stacks of Arcane Acuity​.\nYou can use Create or Destroy Water​ to cover enemies in Wet​. This enables your casters or you with lightning scrolls to deal double damage.\nBlindness​ is an awesome concentrationless spell. I would recommend using it on mages and archers, to force them to come close and luckily, step on Spike Growth.\nIf you are using Bhaalist Armour, your weapon damage and spike damage will be doubled.\nWith Luminous Armour, you want to keep enemies on your spikes so that they would constantly get Radiating Orb​ and Reverberation​ debuffs."

You will still have to attack with the weapon for the main hand and use bonus actions to attack with fists. I only recommend using this until you get the first gloves with bonus damage, like Gloves of Cinder and Sizzle or Tavern Brawler​ feat.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nIf you are using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength this is the best bow in terms of damage. However, this is a contender for a dedicated archer and requires Longbow proficiency. You can get it as an elf.\n\n\nHunting Shortbow\nExcellent bow against monstrosities. There are plenty of them in Act 1.\n\n\nHead\nHaste Helm\nProvides increased speed at the start of the combat.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nThe only option in Act 1 that is okay, is by providing once-per-turn invisibility. Only available to Dark Urge origin.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nGives +2 Dexterity making it a very good choice for the end of Act 1 and the start of Act 2.\n\n\nArmour of Uninhibited Kushigo\nSomewhat relatable first unarmed build armor. It is nothing special as I do not think you will utilize the effect.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Cinder and Sizzle\nIt gives fire damage, increasing the variety of damage types that you do.\n\n\nThe Sparkle Hands\nAmazing gloves that after the first hit will give Lightning Charges. These then provide bonus 1 damage lightning and can stack up with more Lightning Charges.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nAvoids slipping on various terrains and most importantly unlocks Misty Step each short rest. These boots can last till Act 3, as walking on icy surfaces can be deadly for melee build. The item removes this problem.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding \nAllows the Monk to walk freely on difficult terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet\nGreat amulet that will be useful for most of the game. With its actions, it is the perfect choice for Monk.\n\n\nRings\nCrusher's Ring\nImproves movement speed, making it easier to reach your next target.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nGives defensive bonuses to Armour Class and Saving Throws."

Requires Longbow proficiency.\n\n\nBow of the Banshee\nWith Slashing Flourish, you can apply frighten to two enemies at the same time\n\n\nHead\nHat of Uninhibited Kushigo\nVery relevant helmet for the Way of the Four Elements Monk. You can use your fist attacks with bonus action to power up Spell Save DC. Then your spells will have a better success.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success.\n\n\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nIf you have this, it is still a solid choice.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you can wear medium armor, this is an amazing choice even if you lose the benefits of Unarmoured Defence.\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nStill a solid option throughout Act 2 due to bonus Dexterity.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nDeals bonus necrotic damage with unarmed attacks and can apply bleeding.

However, this requires Longbow proficiency, which is only obtained by Elves.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives a big boost to the initiative, guaranteeing that you can go first. However, you will need to get Longbow proficiency from race.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nBow from Act 1, is useful for a bonus to initiative.\n\n\nHead\nHorns of the Berserker\nOverall, the best headwear for Monk. However, you will lose the bonus Spell Save DC from Hat of Uninhibited Kushigo.\n\n\nHood of the Weave\nMentioning this option in case you would like to try it for increased Spell Save DC. However, it would be better utilized by a caster in the group.\n\n\nScabby Pugilist Circlet\nEarly Act 3 helmet, that improves damage when surrounded. Can be a replacement for Hat of Uninhibited Kushigo if you are not utilizing any of the spells.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement(BiS)\nImproves the chances of attacks missing the wearer until getting hit for that turn.\n\n\nArmor\nVest of Soul Rejuvenation(BiS)\nThe best option for Four Elements Monk with unarmored clothing. Another aspect is that it provides additional reaction options when enemies miss you. To top all of this it gives +2 Armour Class.\n\n\nGarb of The Land and Sky\nBest for additional armour class, other effects will require you to use bonus action, so it's best to activate them before combat.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Soul Catching(BiS)\nThe best gloves for the Monk build. Provides 1d10 force damage boost.\n\n\nGauntlets of Frost Giant Strength\nThe only option for gauntlets is if you do not plan on using Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. However, without it, you lose other glove options with cool damage effects.\n\n\nServitor of the Black Hand Gloves\nEach of these gloves provides a different element damage bonus and various spells. Choose the element that you deal the least damage with, this way you increase the variety of damage. You want to be able to deal damage to enemies that will be resistant to Blunt attacks.\n\n\nSeraphic Pugilist Gloves\n\n\nSnow-Dusted Monastery Gloves\n\n\nThunderpalm Strikers\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Uninhibited Kushigo\nThe best boots hands down for Monk build. Be sure to have at least 16 Wisdom, to best utilize these.\n\n\nAmulet\nSentient Amulet(BiS)\nThe upgraded version of the amulet is a perfect choice for Monk.\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nIt makes any Constitution ability investment redundant as it maximizes it to 23 points. Gives a huge survivability boost. However, I would only use this, if your Monk has problems with survivability.\n\n\nKhalid's Gift\nThe amulet gives +1 to Wisdom. However, to take full effect you will need to respec, to have Wisdom at either 19 or 17, to get that +1 proficiency bonus.\n\n\nMagic Amulet\nGives an Advantage on attack. I would use this only if you do not have Risky Ring. Otherwise, this does not provide much use, besides Saving Throw Advantage.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring(BiS)\nA perfect ring for bonus damage. It requires the enemy to be obscured, so check the stealth icon, whether the sun is half-empty or full-empty.\n\n\nCallous Glow Ring(BiS)\nThe ring effect can be activated easily by having someone cast Light on the monk.\n\n\nKiller's Sweetheart\nThe amulet can give a huge boost to damage. However, I would be cautious using it. It would be best served to something like a Paladin, that can deal bigger burst damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armor class is a good bonus, and the ring still takes place."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMelf's First Staff\nThe best staff for caster in Act 1 as it gives bonus Spell Save DC, improving spell success.\n\n\nThe Spellsparkler\nIf this is free, you could use it to get some bonuses from The Protecty Sparkswall armor.\n\n\nTorch\nDo you think I am joking? Fortunately, no. With Shillelagh​ spell this becomes one of the strongest early-game weapons able to surpass in damage all two-handed weapons. You can even dual-wield these, to have strong killers for most of Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat. I recommend this for the early games, as you will have low dexterity.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip two of these so that you can attack with your bonus action. This is a great way to get some bonus damage, especially if you cannot reach the target. Only works if you are a Drow.\n\n\nHead\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nThe only truly relevant headwear for Act 1. There are other options but they are just side bonuses.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing really of note here.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Protecty Sparkswall\nThe best caster armor in Act 1.\n\n\nGithyanki Half Plate\nThe most relevant early-game armor, that you can take from Lae'zel\n\n\nGloves\nBracers of Defence\nThe +2 Armour class is a big boost especially if you do not have a shield proficiency.\n\n\nGloves of Dexterity\nTo be fair these gloves can be a decent option if they are free. You will get a bonus Armour Class from increased Dexterity.\n\n\nWinter's Clutches\nThese gloves can be useful when using spells like Ice Knife​ and later Ice Storm. Although this is not a dedicated Cold build the Encrusted with Frost effect is very useful for weakening enemies and getting them prone.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Striding\nExcellent shoes, as you will be casting Concentration spells left and right. This will reduce your chance of getting the spell canceled.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nExcellent boots, although I would leave them for frontline character if their slots are free. Can be used to avoid getting hit while running away.\n\n\nAmulet\nPearl of Power Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives mobility improvement thanks to the Misty Step​ spell.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Protection\nThe best option for Act 1. The bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nI would say there is a niche use of this early in the game when you can cast Healing Word​ with bonus action to buff your allies.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nThe ring can be useful if you are running with a dual-wield Torch in the early game."
      ],
      "2": [
        "For Act 2, you will be dropping that heavy armor for some great medium ones. Some of the items will still be the best ones even if they are from Act 1. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (Two-Handed)\n-\nUse the ones from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAmazing bow that allows to precast Haste​ before combat. This may not seem big as you can use Potion of Speed, but sometimes its short duration is not enough. Otherwise, stay with bows from the previous act.\n\n\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nThese hand crossbows are excellent if you are a Drow to utilize the bonus damage from Symbiotic Entity​ using bonus action.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nThe best caster headwear in Act 2.\n\n\nCircle of Bones\nImproves survivabilty of your summons and allows resurrecting additional undead.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nFleshmelter Cloak\nDeal additional damage to the attackers.\n\n\nArmor\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nIf you need a higher Armour Class and The Protecty Sparkswall is taken, this is a perfect alternative.\n\n\nRobe of Exquisite Focus\nYou can wear this if The Protecty Sparkswall is taken.\n\n\nGloves\n-\nSpecifically, for the Spore Druid build, Act 2, does not bring many options. So reuse gloves from Act 1.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nThese gloves are a decent option if you are using Shillelagh​ often. The damage rider will give a decent boost. They will also work with offhand crossbow attacks.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nOptional boots if you need a little bit more Armour Class in your normal form.\n\n\nAmulet\nStrange Tendril Amulet\nI like Evard's Black Tentacles​ spell, as it is a very strong crowd-control option.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn. This is useful before you obtain the Sorcerer dip.\n\n\nRings\nEversight Ring\nIf you have a Darkness​ party, or members who use this spell, being able to see inside, can make you extremely sturdy.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nExcellent ring, that you can activate its effects with your control spells."

        "This is the last act of the game, where you will get access to the most powerful items. To get them as early as possible you will need some planning, but overall, it should not be a problem. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nMarkoheshkir\nThe most powerful stave in the game. If it is free, feel free to use it and activate relevant Kereska's Favour​ based on the spells you use. My favorite picks are Frost of Dark Winter and Bolts of Doom.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\nWith the amount of summons, any of the buffs from Phalar Aluve: Melody​ will give big power boost to them. You can get Dual Wielder​ feat to wear it with staves like Markoheshkir or Staff of Cherished Necromancy.\n\n\nStaff of Cherished Necromancy\nThe staff can be used to cast Necromancy spells for free. One of them is Blight.\n\n\nStaff of Spell Power\nVery powerful stave that also gives access to Arcane Battery, giving a free (including level 6) spell cast.\n\n\nWoe\nGives additional effects like healing.\n\n\nRanged\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +2\nA solid hand crossbow that you can obtain in Act 3.\n\n\nHead\nHood of the Weave\nThe best caster headwear, that gives +2 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHelldusk Helmet\nThe helmet can be used to be able to see in Darkness​ if your group utilizes this spell.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of The Weave\nThe best cloak in the game for casters.\n\n\nCloak of Displacement\nGreat way to avoid attacks and reduce the chance of enemy attacks landing.\n\n\nArmor\nArmour of the Sporekeeper\nThis is the most relevant armour for Spore Druid. You will gain a special action to summon various Spores. The most relevant ones are Haste Spores, which give additional action for your, allies and your summons.\n\n\nArmour of Landfall\nOne of the best caster items in general, as it gives Constitution Saving Throw an advantage, resulting in less spell cancelation.  Moreover, it improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nRobe of the Weave\nGives bonus Armour Class and improves Spell Save DC.\n\n\nGloves\nHelldusk Gloves\nGives bonuses to Spell Save DC, which will increase spell success chance.\n\n\nGauntlet of the Tyrant\nGives +1 Spell Save DC.\n\n\nQuickspell Gloves\nAllows casting spells with bonus action once per short rest.\n\n\nBoots\nBonespike Boots\nThese are the best boots for a summoner-heavy build. You can use Brutal Leap​ to jump close to an enemy and make them Prone​. The action uses your spellcasting modifier, making it have a very high chance of success. Prone​ enemies will be easy targets \n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nHelldusk Boots\nYou can avoid failing a saving throw, which might break your concentration using a reaction.\n\n\nBonespike Boots\nGives bonus armor class and increased saving throw rolls.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of The Devout\nAlthough this is the best amulet of the caster, generally it is best in the slot for cleric builds. However, I would not skip this if you are playing this build as a main character.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nIt allows restoring spell slots easily.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Feywild Sparks\nThe only ring that gives access to +1 Spell Save DC. This effect is not listed.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nStill a good ring from Act 1, that will work with some of your spells.\n\n\nCrypt Lord Ring\nThe ring fits the theme, giving access to another summon to join your army.\n\n\nRing of Evasion\nAllows avoiding the fail of Dexterity saving throw. These usually are wide-area spells.\n\n\nRing of Twilight\nImproves Armour class while obscured, also works in Wild Shape. For this to activate you need to enter the form in a shadowy area."

The main reason is that its features, are pretty hard to utilize fully for a caster, especially when the class already has plenty of good spells. Still, Spore Druid does offer a unique playstyle in my opinion, thanks to its features. You will be able to boast a small army of summons - skeletons, fungal zombies, dryad, and elementals. This does come with some pros and cons, but you should still get an enjoyable setup. That's not all, Circle of Spores has a special mechanic Symbiotic Entity. This makes Spore Druid tanky, with a significant layer of temporary HP. To top it off you will get a necrotic damage rider, but as a spellcaster, it is mostly redundant. Sure you can use it on off-hand hand crossbow attacks or Shillelagh, but this is effective mostly in Act 1.",

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nI would say this is the best weapon pick until late into the game when you obtain Spirit Guardians. Before that, Phalar Aluve's special actions will provide powerful buffs for the whole party.\n\n\nBlood of Lathander\nI recommend getting this item. Although it may not be as useful now, it will become powerful later on, when you unlock Spirit Guardians​ and help activate Radiant Orb effects.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nHand Crossbow +1\nEquip 2 of these to have the option to attack with bonus action using an offhand attack.\n\n\nShield\nAdamantine Shield\nIt provides a substantial defensive boost by reducing critical hit damage.\n\n\nSafeguard Shield\nGives a bonus to saving throws, easily accessible early in the game.\n\n\nHead\nHoly Lance Helm\nA solid helmet that will deal 1d4 radiant damage if the enemy misses you. Moreover, it will also activate any reverbation effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nCap of Curing\nSadly this does not work with The Whispering Promise, but still, the health restoration during combat and Combat Inspiration​ buff is great.\n\n\nThe Shadespell Circlet\nOpens up opportunities for easy ways to improve Spell Save DC.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\n-\nNothing relevant for the build.\n\n\nArmor\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor for Act 1, will give good protection.\n\n\nLuminous Armour\nThe armor will be very good later on, once you obtain radiant damage sources with Callous Glow Ring and Spirit Guardians. Be sure to get it.\n\n\nBlazer of Benevolence\nA decent intermediary armor, that will grant additional hit points.\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of Power\nThese gloves are pretty good if you use melee weapon attacks. This allows you to land additional debuff for attack rolls and saving throws.\n\n\nHellrider's Pride\nDefensive gloves that give damage resistance to those that the Cleric heals. The perfect combo to be used with Healing Word​ + The Whispering Promise.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe best boots in terms of offensive damage. They will give Reverbation stacks when you apply status effects, for example, Spirit Guardians. You will not use them much for now, but they will be useful later on.\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nIt is one of the best boots, giving a total advantage for movement on difficult surfaces. It also gives Misty Step​ to increase that mobility.\n\n\nBoots of Speed\nThese boots are a good option, as they make it easier to avoid opportunity attacks.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Restoration\nThe best cleric amulet early in the game. Use the spells together with The Whispering Promise to apply buffs on your allies.\n\n\nRings\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe best ring for a cleric early in the game. This will apply Bless​ to allies when you use a healing spell like the Mass Healing Word.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAdds additional damage to weapon attacks.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe bonus Armour Class is a great boost for survivability."

        "You might opt out of using a ranged weapon which becomes a viable option once you get Extra Attack. Another important item is Callous Glow Ring. If you will use it on another character, I would then disregard items like Luminous Armour, Gloves of Belligerent Skies, and Luminous Gloves until you unlock Spirit Guardians​ at level 10. So use the alternative gear until then. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nUse weapons from previous acts.\n\n\nRanged\nTitanstring Bow\nBow becomes a good option, especially once you get Extra Attack. I would also take Sharpshooter: All In​ feat and drink Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. With all of these, the Valour Bard becomes a good ranged character if the weapon is freely available.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe bow gives initiative.\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nShield\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nWhat makes this shield amazing is that by wearing it you will be going first most of the time during encounters. This is a great way to apply some control spells or weaken enemies.\n\n\nHead\nFistbreaker Helm\nImproves Spell Save DC which results in higher spell success.\n\n\nMarksmanship Hat\nGives an additional attack roll bonus, and works perfectly with ranged weapons if you decide to use them.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor for clerics using Radiant damage.\n\n\nGloves\nLuminous Gloves\nApplies Radiating Orb. I would use these together with Callous Glow Ring to weaken foes.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\nWorks with Callous Glow Ring for an easy way to apply Reverbation. Choose either these or Luminous Gloves.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nThese gloves are pretty good and improve damage with weapon attacks\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nIt's pretty easy to inflict a condition and the Reverbation debuff can prove very valuable. You can use them with Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nEvasive Shoes\nGives a bonus to armor class.\n\n\nBoots of Brilliance\nAlthough they are not very powerful, it can still work well for Bardic Inspiration​ restoration.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of the Harpers\nAllows casting a Shield​ spell, and can be a lifesaver if attacked heavily for one turn.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nThis ring can work well with your Bow, to apply Radiating Orbs from Luminous Armour. If you will use this ring on another character\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nThe ring is still a powerful buff source with Healing Word.\n\n\nRing of Mental Inhibition\nApplies Mental Fatigue debuff, weakening spell success.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\n An easy source of additional psychic damage."

        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nTo be fair, for melee options, there are no better items to what was mentioned already.\n\n\nRanged\nGontr Mael\nA bow alternative to Titanstring Bow, with various special effects and additional radiant damage rider.\n\n\nTitanstring Bow\nTechnically this would be the most powerful bow, however, this requires using Bhaalist Armour and activating Aura Of Murder​ from an outside source.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed. I would only use this if you are concentrating on melee attacks and spell casting.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nOne of the best shields in the game. Overall, it serves more of a defensive role giving advantages on Spell Saving Throws.\n\n\nKetheric's Shield\nThe best shield for casters as it gives +1 Spell Save DC, increasing spell success.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nA very powerful helmet that gives additional bonus action. This does require sacrificing half of your HP, so I would use it together with Amulet of Greater Health. With additional bonus action you can use Combat Inspiration​ or Healing Word​ for additional buffs.\n\n\nHoly Lance Helm\nWhen enemies miss you, the additional radiant damage can activate effects from Gloves of Belligerent Skies, Luminous Armour, etc.\n\n\nHelmet of Arcane Acuity\nThis can be a powerful tool especially if you opt out for more of a controller setup, especially if you do not have access to Luminous Armour. Use this together with Band of the Mystic Scoundrel.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nIt can be used for an additional daze effect if you are using reverbation items like Boots of Stormy Clamour and Gloves of Belligerent Skies.\n\n\nArmor\nLuminous Armour\nThe best armor pick for this build, to use together with Spirit Guardians. If not, check other options.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nOne of the best medium armors in the game.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nThese armors become available based on major decisions in Act 2. The main goal here is to get a Concentration Saving Throw advantage which helps with maintaining spells.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nGloves\nLuminous Gloves\nPerfect for use with all the radiant setups. Pick the preferred debuff - Radiant Orb vs Reverbation based on gear availability or other criteria.\n\n\nGloves of Belligerent Skies\n\n\nThe Reviving Hands\nExcellent gloves for buffing allies with Healing Word.\n\n\nBoots\n-\nReuse the same boots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nThe best amulet in terms of combat potential. Together with Helmet of Grit, you can have a decent amount of HP even at 50%, and improve the number of attacks.\n\n\nAmulet of The Devout\nA powerful amulet that gives additional Channel Divinity charge and improved Spell Save DC.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nAn excellent amulet to improve the rolls against mental saving throws.\n\n\nSpellcrux Amulet\nCan be used to restore spell slots and unequipped.\n\n\nRings\nCallous Glow Ring\nHelps with applying radiant damage on weapon hits. Will work extremely well with Bow weapon and multiple.\n\n\nThe Whispering Promise\nExcellent ring for debuffing.\n\n\nBand of the Mystic Scoundrel\nThis item is an option to be used together with Helmet of Arcane Acuity if you will not utilize Spirit Guardians.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nA good ring to help maintain Armour Class to avoid enemy attacks."

It can give the highest armor class with high Dexterity until later in Act 3.\n\n\nGloves\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\nThe improved version of Dark Justiciar Gauntlets also allows casting Darkness spells.\n\n\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nProvides bonus 1d4 fire damage with weapon attacks and can inflict bleeding.

A good survivability choice, but not mandatory in my opinion.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nThe amulet will be a good option until endgame, as the 1d6 poison damage is a good boost. However, it does not allow coatings, so be sure to check for alternatives if you plan on using them.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nThis is a bit more powerful than the ring below, but it requires your foes to be at least lightly obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage. But you will need a source of Concentration\n\n\nCaustic Band\nThe bonus damage is a good choice even in Act 2.\n\n\nRisky Ring\nThe ring is somewhat useful, as it gives an easy way for Advantage and helps counteract Sharpshooter: All In​ effect. Still, it has plenty of negative side effects, so I would only use it if you have problems hitting enemies."

It is in high demand by multiple builds.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThe dagger effect of additional critical damage also applies to ranged attacks.\n\n\nKnife of the Undermountain King\nStill a relevant stat stick weapon from Act 1.\n\n\nRanged\nHand Crossbow +2\nThis is an improved version that you can dual-wield with another hand crossbow, for an offensive option using a bonus action.\n\n\nHellfire Hand Crossbow\nAs you can get Hiding​ or Invisible​ easily, the bonus effect is easy to apply for slightly more damage. The main selling point is +2 Enchantment.\n\n\nNe'er Misser\nUses force damage, which many enemies can't resist.\n\n\nShield\nViconia's Walking Fortress\nIf stat stick weapon access is limited, due to other builds, use any shields that you can get your hands on. Dual Wielding Setup For this setup, the goal is to wear the strongest daggers/shortswords for maximum damage. The ranged slots kind of become stat sticks to boost their damage: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nCrimson Mischief(BiS)\nGives a flat 7-piece damage boost. Together with Aura Of Murder,​ this will result in 14 damage. It's the strongest one-handed piercing weapon.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nThe dagger's critical damage bonuses also apply main weapon.\n\n\nRender of Mind and Body\nAs you have multiple ways of getting an Advantage, the 1d8 psychic damage rider is a very large bonus, making this weapon very powerful even in Act 3.\n\n\nOff-Hand\nBelm(BiS)\nCan use bonus action attacks to inflict the same damage as the main hand weapon, with all bonuses.\n\n\nBlade of the First Blood\nThe additional effect of True Strike Riposte​ can be handy, and provides bonus damage.\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow(BiS)\nThe bow is the best pick in terms of damage boost as it gives +7 on all critical weapon attacks. The only goal is to ensure that your party can apply Hold Monster​/Hold Person​ for a 100% crit chance and maximum damage.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nGives +3 Initiative, almost guaranteeing that you go first.\n\n\nThe Dead Shot\nDecreases the roll requirement for Critical Hit by 1. Other Equipment: Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nProvides additional attack via bonus action, so you can shoot for additional time. Use Transfuse Health​ to quickly reach the HP threshold. I would also recommend using Amulet of Greater Health as otherwise you will be an easy target for your foes.\n\n\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nProvides a significant damage boost with high intelligence and Arcane Synergy​ buff.\n\n\nHelm of Balduran\nIf using Broodmother's Revenge, this helmet's effect ensures that you get bonus damage on every combat encounter.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nEnsures good survivability by imposing a disadvantage on the attacker's Attack Rolls.\n\n\nCloak of Cunning Brume\nYou can use Cunning Action: Disengage​ to create a fog cloud and hide.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour(BiS)\nThis armor is particularly powerful for melee-piercing weapon wielders - these include daggers and short swords.  It makes them vulnerable to piercing damage unless they have resistance to it. Moreover, it gives bonus initiative, ensuring that you will go first most of the time.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThis medium armor perfectly works with stealth as it does not impose any disadvantages. Moreover, it has a decent armor class for protection.\n\n\nThe Graceful Cloth\nThe armour is still somewhat good. You get various bonuses, and it provides a hefty +2 to Dexterity. Still, it gets outclassed by other options in terms of Armour Class and unique effects.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters(BiS)\nOne of the best gloves in the game, however, could have limited access based on your decisions in the game.\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves are an extremely powerful choice if you have a caster who can apply Hold Monster​/Hold Person. This way, you will have 100% crit chance.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\nThese gloves provide bonuses for every attack. You will be doing many of them, so the bonus fire damage stacks up\n\n\nMartial Exertion Gloves\nIncur 6d6 damage, but gain additional attack points. This neatly fits into the Stealthy playstyle as you can deal damage bonuses on the first turn.\n\n\nBoots\nHelldusk Boots\nThese boots have a wide array of uses - allowing succeeding Saving Throws while using Reaction, a teleportation spell, and ignoring difficult terrain.\n\n\nBoots of Persistence\nGives Freedom of Movement​ and Longstrider​ actions effects.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge(BiS)\nBonus poison damage on each hit with the weapon is a great improvement\n\n\nAmulet of Greater Health\nA huge health boost. Especially good with Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA great ring for bonus damage, but requires your foes to be lightly obscured.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nThe ring is still a powerful choice to ensure consistent bonus damage. You can get a concentration spell via scrolls or if using Dark Justiciar Half-Plate/Dark Justiciar Half-Plate by casting Shar's Aegis.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nAmazing choice till the end of the game as each attack will apply this bonus acid damage.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nSlight boost to survivability."

        "For the start of the game 2-handed setup is my go-to recommendation. Be sure to grab Great Weapon Master: All In​ if you are up for it. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nPhalar Aluve\nThe weapon is my go-to choice until Act 3. It is Finesse one, meaning it works with Rakish Sneak Attack (Melee)​ and Dirty Trick: Flick o' the Wrist​. Moreover, you get Phalar Aluve: Melody,​ which gives you an excellent use for main action, to buff allies and yourself. The weapon can be obtained fairly early.\n\n\nLarethian's Wrath\nThe second option, which has finesse property, and a great action attack - Razor Gale.\n\n\nAny +1 weapon\nGet any finesse weapon with a +1 enchantment, like Rapier +1.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nGives bonus initiative, allowing one to go earlier in combat.\n\n\nGandrel's Aspiration\nGives easy Advantage against monstrosities, for all weapon attacks.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nExcellent headwear that gives Arcane Synergy. You can easily trigger it with Booming Blade.\n\n\nHaste Helm\nImproves movement speed, allowing one to reach important targets easily, early in the game.\n\n\nCloak\nThe Deathstalker Mantle\nAccessible if you are Dark Urge.\n\n\nArmor\nThe Graceful Cloth\nI think this is the best Act 1 armour, as it gives +2 Dexterity, which translates into multiple benefits. Make sure to cast Mage Armour​ on yourself from an ally caster if you are not wearing any other light or medium pieces.\n\n\nAdamantine Scale Mail\nWith the hexblade dip, you are able to wear medium armor. They alleviate any Armour Class problems for Act 1 and simplify progression.\n\n\nScale Mail +1\n\n\nGloves\nGloves of the Growling Underdog\nThese gloves are the two best options. The Gloves of the Growling Underdog give a pretty easy advantage, and as a swashbuckler, you will try to stay close to the enemies. The Gloves of Baneful Striking are an excellent choice for debuffs and can benefit not just you, but your allies.\n\n\nGloves of Baneful Striking\n\n\nWondrous Gloves\nGives additional armour class for survivability.\n\n\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nDefensive gloves against ranged attacks.\n\n\nBoots\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\nOne of the best boots in the game with all the bonuses and easy use of Misty Step.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\nThe boots can easily apply Reverberation​ via Booming Blade or any of the dirty tricks. I think this build can somewhat as a debuffer, especially as you will be using Phalar Aluve: Melody.\n\n\nBoots of Genial Striding\nAllows movement without limits on Difficult Terrain.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIf you can acquire it, this can be the best amulet option for most of the game.\n\n\nAmulet of Branding\nExcellent amulet that gives an easy vulnerability source, for the mid-game.\n\n\nAmulet of Misty Step\nGives a free Misty Step,​ which greatly improves your mobility.\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nUse this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy. The Arcane Synergy​ effect is easy to activate with Booming Blade.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nBonus armour for survivability.\n\n\nCrusher's Ring\nMovement speed boost, which is especially important in some big area fights in Act 1.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nImproves damage on each hit."
      ],
      "2": [
        "Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\n-\nUse the Act 1 weapons, as they are still the best picks.\n\n\nRanged\nBow of Awareness\nThe bonus initiative still plays a major role\n\n\nDarkfire Shortbow\nAllows casting Haste.\n\n\nHead\nDiadem of Arcane Synergy\nStill serves as the best headwear in terms of damage boost. If another character is using it, an alternative is Ring of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nCovert Cowl\nIt can give a marginal boost to damage with a decrease in critical hit rolls.\n\n\nFistbreaker Helm\nA distant option to improve Spell Save DC and initiative. I would say this is a low priority and would rather use this on a dedicated caster. But the dirty tricks like Dirty Trick: Flick o' the Wrist​ can benefit from it.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Protection\nImproves survivability and Saving Throw success. You want to equip this cloak to maintain that good Armour Class.\n\n\nArmor\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\nOne of the best-looking armors in the game. You can wear them, and they provide useful bonuses like an Advantage on stealth checks. The main highlight is Shar's Aegis,​ which improves Armour Class and gives you an option to wear Strange Conduit Ring.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Half-Plate\n\n\nYuan-ti Scale Mail\nThe best medium armor in this stage, with a decent Armour Class boost, and not limited by +2 Dexterity modifier.\n\n\nStudded Leather Armour +2\nIt can be obtained late in Act 2, once you reach level 9. Solid armor, the main draw is its decent 15 Armour Class.\n\n\nShadeclinger Armour\nThe advantage of saving throws is usually overlooked. Still, this is an excellent bonus, enabling better spell and various effects resistance.\n\n\nGloves\nFlawed Helldusk Gloves\nAll of these gauntlets are great options as they give a permanent damage rider. Just choose which damage you prefer - fire or necrotic.\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nDark Justiciar Gauntlets\n\n\nGloves of Battlemage's Power\nThis can be an alternative to Gloves of Baneful Striking, and you can activate their effect with Booming Blade. This will help you land any of the Dirty Tricks. But I do think it is redundant, compared to other options.\n\n\nBoots\nEvasive Shoes\nGives +1 Armour Class, which is a significant survivability boost.\n\n\n-\nBoots from Act 1 are still perfect.\n\n\nAmulet\nBroodmother's Revenge\nContinues to be the best amulet in terms of damage boost.\n\n\nAmulet of the Harpers\nExcellent pick with Shield​ spell, without using your spell slots.\n\n\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nExcellent amulet that can help in tight situations when you are Downed.\n\n\nRings\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nA very good ring that inherits damage from your weapon and works especially well in Act 2.\n\n\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nCan be easily activated thanks to Booming Blade​ on the first attack. Use this ring or Diadem of Arcane Synergy.\n\n\nStrange Conduit Ring\nI would wear this together with Dark Justiciar Half-Plate or Dark Justiciar Half-Plate and activate Shar's Aegis​ for additional damage.\n\n\nRisky Ring\n This ring is an option, as having a high hit chance makes it easier to land your dirty tricks and debuff enemies.\n\n\nCaustic Band\nStill good options from Act 1 that prove useful, especially in the first hours.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nProvides +1 Armour Class to avoid hits."

      "3": [
        "I think you can do two setups. They depend on what items are available to you. My preferred one is the Piercing Duelist. Piercing Setup This is my go-to recommendation for the best damage. You will need Bhaalist Armour to utilize all the effects. This does require respec at Withers and take Savage Attacker​ feat instead of Great Weapon Master: All In. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nDuellist's Prerogative\nThe best fitting weapon in terms of look for the Swashbuckler. Of course, it is also very good, with additional reaction and bonus action attack. Make sure you are not wearing anything else in the offhand.\n\n\nCrimson Mischief\nAlternative option, which should be dual-wielded with one of the off-hand weapon options that I suggest below.\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nOnly used to buff your main weapon with Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nMelee (Off-Hand)\nBelm\nIf you will use Crimson Mischief, this is the best option to pair it with, giving Perfectly Balanced Strike, to make another attack with your main-hand weapon.\n\n\nDolor Amarus\nAlternative option, which is especially powerful if you will land critical hits, thanks to paralyzing effects like Hold Monster​/Hold Person.\n\n\nArmor\nBhaalist Armour\nThe only recommended armor for this setup. The Aura Of Murder​ is an extremely powerful debuff that doubles your piercing damage, this is why these particular weapons were recommended. 2-Handed Setup This setup is aimed at those who did not get Bhaalist Armour and continue using Great Weapon Master: All In​ feat, to maximize damage and obtain an additional bonus action attack. Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nMelee (One-Handed)\nThe Dancing Breeze\nThe best choice to go here is The Dancing Breeze. The finesse property +2 enchantment and unique Whirlwind Attack​ are excellent for Swashbuckler playstyle. Otherwise, you can continue using Phalar Aluve.\n\n\nPhalar Aluve\n\n\nDrakethroat Glaive\nOnly used to buff your main weapon with Draconic Elemental Weapon.\n\n\nArmor\nHelldusk Armour\nThis armor is relevant especially if you decided to go with 16 Dexterity, as it will compensate well for the Armour Class.\n\n\nArmour of Agility\nThe best medium armor with a full dexterity bonus to armour class.\n\n\nElegant Studded Leather\nGives access to the Shield​ spell, which can be activated once per short rest. Other Items Slot\nItem\nDescription\n\n\nRanged\nVicious Shortbow\nThe ultimate bow for a stat stick. It gives a special effect, which inflicts additional critical damage with any weapon hit. You can easily guarantee critical hits with Hold Person​/Hold Monster.\n\n\nHellrider Longbow\nThe bonus initiative is an excellent boost to go early in combat. If it is not a surprise round, it is almost guaranteed. I would only use this if you are concentrating on melee attacks and spell casting.\n\n\nBow of Awareness\nThe +1 initiative is still good.\n\n\nHead\nHelmet of Grit\nThis helmet gives an additional bonus action when you have less than 50% HP. For this reason, I urge you to get the Amulet of Greater Health to maximize it and retain good survivability.\n\n\nCloak\nCloak of Displacement\nIt provides an increased chance of avoiding enemy attacks with attack rolls.\n\n\nThunderskin Cloak\nIf you have a Cleric in the party with Revorb setup, or you use Boots of Stormy Clamour, this cloak can easily apply Dazed.\n\n\nGloves\nLegacy of the Masters\nAny of these gloves will prove useful in my opinion. Helldusk Gloves give some fire damage and Spell Save DC for landing tricks. Legacy of the Masters is better in terms of weapon damage potential, and with Bhaalist Armour, their bonuses are doubled.\n\n\nHelldusk Gloves\n\n\nCraterflesh Gloves\nThese gloves can be ridiculously overpowered if you can guarantee critical hits.\n\n\nBoots\nBoots of Persistence\nThere are plenty of boot options, and all of them are good. The main outlier might be Boots of Stormy Clamour, which gives an easy way to apply Reverberation​ with all the tools at Swashbuckler's disposal.\n\n\nBoots of Stormy Clamour\n\n\nDisintegrating Night Walkers\n\n\n-\nBoots from previous acts.\n\n\nAmulet\nAmulet of Greater Health\nI would say this is a key item for the build. Pair it with Helmet of Grit for additional bonus action, which greatly improves what you can do - another dirty trick or maybe Perfectly Balanced Strike.\n\n\nBroodmother's Revenge\nIn terms of offensive power, it is the best option.\n\n\nFey Semblance Amulet\nThe amulet is a great option for a boost in spell resistance via Saving Throws.\n\n\n-\nOptions from previous acts\n\n\nRings\nRing of Arcane Synergy\nThe best option to wear, as the helmet slot will be taken by Helmet of Grit.\n\n\nShadow-Cloaked Ring\nDeals additional damage that is inherited from your weapon. This does require the target to be Lightly Obscured, which is easy to achieve.\n\n\nRing of Protection\nThe +1 Armour Class is still a relevant boost for survivability."
