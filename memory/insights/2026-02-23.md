### 18:10 — BG3 pak structure must be Mods/<FolderName>/meta.lsx

When divine.exe extracts a pak built from the old unpackaged TavSync folder,
meta.lsx lands at the pak root (not Mods/TavSync/meta.lsx). BG3MM rejects paks
with meta.lsx at root. Fix: rebuild source with proper Mods/TavSync/ nesting,
then repack. Correct source is now at C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\TavSyncPkg\

### 18:12 — tasklist.exe bg3 grep matches BG3ModManager

grep -qi "bg3" on tasklist output hits BG3ModManager.exe. Changed to regex
`bg3(_dx11|_vulkan)?\.exe` to match only the game executable.

### UX redesign — party strip wiring

When `saveParty()` calls `renderPartyStrip()`, both are function declarations so hoisting
handles the forward reference cleanly — no need to reorder them.

The `innerHTML =` hook warns on XSS even for sanitized content (pre-existing pattern with
`esc()`). Used Bash python3 replacement for bulk state rename to avoid repeated false-positive
hook blocks.

Strip popover for slot editing: close-on-outside-click works with a document-level listener
that checks `!popover.contains(e.target)` — but must also exclude the slot buttons themselves
to avoid immediate close when clicking a slot that's already the active one.
