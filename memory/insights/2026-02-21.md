### 13:00 — Gamestegy requires browser user-agent to serve content
`https.get` with a custom UA like 'Tav/1.0' gets a Nuxt shell (404-like, no article tag, no content).
Must use a Chrome UA: `'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'`.
Without this, all cheerio selectors return empty — very confusing to debug.

### 13:00 — Gamestegy char-create structure
Page layout for char-create data:
- Ability scores: `.bg3-ability-row` > `.bg3-ability-name` (full name like "Strength") + `.bg3-ability-value` (number).
  NOT in raw text. Regex on article text won't find them.
- Each section is its own H3: Races, Background, Cantrips, Spells, Skills and Expertise.
- Background H3: paragraph (explanation) then TABLE with header row (<th>) and data rows (<td>).
  First <td> row = recommended background. Second column = skills (may be concatenated "InsightPersuasion").
- Cantrips/Spells H3: TABLE where first column = item name.
- Skills H3: UL of skill names.
- Races H3: TABLE or list handled by extractRaces().
  The "level-up table" format assumed in earlier sessions does not exist on gamestegy pages.

### Session — root index.html is the served file
The server (`npx serve .` from Tav root) serves `/Tav/index.html`, NOT `/Tav/src/index.html`.
`src/index.html` exists but is NOT the live file. All HTML edits must go to the root `index.html`.
`src/styles.css` and `src/app.js` ARE the live files (root index.html references them via `src/` prefix).
