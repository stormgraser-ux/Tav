### 23:00 — BG3 Patch 7+ silently rejects custom pak mods

BG3 rewrites `modsettings.lsx` on every launch and drops any mod it doesn't recognize from the in-game mod manager (which only sees mod.io-registered mods). Locking the file read-only prevents the overwrite but also prevents BG3 from loading the mod at all — it needs write access to validate/update the settings.

Even with a properly structured pak (correct meta.lsx with Type="Add-on", TargetModes, etc.), correct LSPK format from Divine.exe, and both Mods + ModOrder sections in modsettings.lsx — BG3 silently refuses to load it.

**Workaround:** Skip the pak entirely. Use BG3SE's `Ext.IO.LoadFile()` to load Lua scripts from the Script Extender directory via console. Split into server script (dump logic + net listener) and client script (F6 key handler). Two console commands per session, works reliably.

### 23:30 — BG3SE client/server context split for hotkeys

Key input events (`Ext.Events.KeyInput`) are client-side only. Party data access (`Osi.DB_Players`, `Ext.Entity.Get`) is server-side only. To bridge: client registers hotkey → sends `Ext.Net.PostMessageToServer()` → server registers `Ext.RegisterNetListener()` and runs the dump. Use global flags (`TavSync`, `TavHotkey`) to prevent double-registration on repeated loads.
